/**
 * Text a person reads must go through the locale files, or a French speaker sees English. A sentence
 * written straight into the page never reaches `public/locales/*.json`, so it can never be translated --
 * and nothing complained, because the language files themselves were valid
 * (tests/locales-contract.test.mjs checks the files, not whether the page uses them).
 *
 * What counts as "written straight into the page": any string literal -- double, single or back quotes,
 * in a ternary, a `||` or a concatenation -- on the right of `.textContent`, `.innerText`,
 * `.placeholder` or `.title` =, inside `confirm(...)` or `alert(...)`, or as the value of
 * `setAttribute("aria-label" | "title" | "placeholder", ...)`. The English fallback handed to
 * `t()`, `say()`, `sayWith()` or `words()` is not an offender: those look the words up first.
 *
 * Not covered: text passed to a file's own helpers (`button("Read it again", ...)`). There is no way
 * to tell from here which helper arguments reach the screen.
 *
 * A file offends by default. The only way out is NOT_YET below, which costs a written reason.
