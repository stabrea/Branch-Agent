/**
 * Q50: when a settings change is put to the owner, the question itself carries the exact before and
 * after ("What Branch learns from experience, Switch: off → on"), not only the name and the value asked
 * for. It is worked out only for the owner in a conversation they started: a caller the settings tools
 * refuse never gets Branch to read the owner's settings into a question. The call's target, which the
 * owner's rules and kept answers match against, stays exactly what the call asked for.
