/**
 * mac7/lockdown-fix, integration review: the holes found in the adversarial pass, each pinned by a
 * test. Lockdown refuses handing work to another computer and steps that send to other apps, the
 * terminal switch ends earlier yeses, and device sockets are closed. A Trunk's side jobs, mixtures and
 * keep-alive pings never reach a sign-in. A task's workflow limit survives saving the steps again,
 * reaches drafted flows, and a finished flow run's limit is cleaned up. Stand-ins and temp folders only.
