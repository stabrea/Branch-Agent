/**
 * Moving the approval preset (src/policy.ts, src/preset-moves.ts).
 *
 *   - A preset replaces its own lines, never the owner's: every refusal the owner has stays through a
 *     move, in front of the new preset's lines. A standing yes ends with the move, as it always has.
 *   - A move is weighed by what the policy answers before and after it, the owner's own rules included,
 *     never by where the preset sits in the list. Any answer that gets looser makes it a less careful
 *     change, which settings.change refuses and settings.loosen asks about every time.
 *
 * Everything runs on its own data folder and a closed port; the owner's own Branch is never touched.
