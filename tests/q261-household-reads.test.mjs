/**
 * Q261: a household person at the window (the window switched to their profile) reads only what is theirs, shared
 * with them, or public. Reading fails closed the way changing already did (src/household-routes.ts householdReads,
 * decided in src/server.ts offLimitsToHousehold): any GET or HEAD not listed answers the one sentence before the
 * route's own code runs, and a socket is refused the same way.
 *
 * - The list is pinned here, entry by entry, so it cannot grow without this file changing in the same review.
 * - Generated over the route table (tests/short-lived-key-routes.mjs), by the rule and over HTTP: every row's GET is
 *   refused unless listed, every HEAD is refused, and a read nobody has written yet is refused too.
 * - Every listed read, asked with the owner's and the person's own task and conversation ids, carries none of the
 *   owner's seeded words, while the owner's own answer does (so the check is not empty) and the person's own
 *   records do reach them.
 * - POST /api/models/switch takes the person's own conversation only: the owner's reads exactly like one that does
 *   not exist, the owner's settings for it are unchanged, and a wrong name does not list the owner's connections
 *   (the /model command included).
 *
 * Mutations (each applied to dist/, this file run, the file put back by hash), and the case each turns red:
 *   R1  offLimitsToHousehold: a GET not listed falls back to the old rule (every plain read open)   → "fails closed"
 *   R2  isRead: HEAD is not a read                                                                → "fails closed"
 *   R3  householdReads: /api/mcp/servers added                                                     → "pinned list"
 *   R4  householdMaySend: a GET matches by prefix (any /api/sessions/... read)                     → "fails closed"
 *   R5  upgrade: the household check on sockets removed                                           → "sockets"
 *   R6  conversation-mode: another conversation's id read for a household person                  → "own data"
 *   R7  models/switch: the conversation check removed                                             → "models/switch"
 *   R8  models/switch: the owner's connection names listed to a household person                  → "models/switch"
 *   R9  /model command: the owner's connection names listed to a household person                 → "models/switch"
 * Run them all: node design/redesign/tools/mutate-q261.mjs (after npx tsc -p .).
