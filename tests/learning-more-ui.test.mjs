/**
 * R17-F: the "Learning, deeper" cards, opened the way a person opens them, at 400 px wide, in a
 * headless browser against a scratch workspace. Every word is behind a key with real French, and
 * every control has a label and a description.
 *
 * Redesign: the old cards (public/learning-more.js, in Library › Memory) are replaced by prototype.html's rows: at
 * Advanced, Library › Memory › "How it learns" has "What it learned, week by week" (the engine's timeline, GET
 * /api/learning-more/journey; public/app/places/library17.js), and Customize › Tools › Skills › "Keeping skills in shape"
 * has "Retire skills nobody uses" (GET /api/learning-more/curator; public/app/places/customize17.js). Each row opens a
 * dialog of the engine's own list. What went with the old cards: a switch card per part, the opt-in to learn from
 * Claude Code and Codex sessions, the provider, meaning search, expiry and read-back cards; the prototype draws none.
