/**
 * P17-D §4: decision models on the owner's own connections (src/decision-models.ts).
 *
 * - Yes or no, pick one, a score and a filter are asked of the chosen connection, with no tools, and the answer is
 *   checked: a pick must be one of the choices, a filter may keep only lines it was given, a score is 1 to 10.
 * - Less sure than the owner's threshold on a separate decision model: the task's own model decides instead.
 * - A list longer than the owner's limit is split.
 * - The "last 24 hours" line counts decisions and their average time; a decision's words are not kept.
 * - Over HTTP: only a connection the owner has may be chosen.
 *
 * Mutation notes (each turns this file red), all in src/decision-models.ts:
 * - checkDecision: drop the `if (!choice) throw` line      -> "a choice that was not offered" fails.
 * - checkDecision: drop the filter range check              -> "a line it was not given" fails.
 * - decide: drop the `result.confidence < settings.minConfidence` re-ask -> "the task's own model decides" fails.
 * - once: drop the split (always `this.single`)              -> "a long list is split" fails.
 * - configure: drop the unknown-model refusal               -> the 400 fails.
