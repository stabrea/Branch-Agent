/**
 * Redesign ("Always allow for <Trunk>"): a standing yes given to one Trunk's question is kept for that Trunk only.
 * Its work goes ahead without asking again; another Trunk doing the same thing is still asked; a yes named for a
 * Trunk other than the one that asked is refused. Scripted model and Trunks; nothing reaches a provider.
