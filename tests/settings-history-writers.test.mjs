/**
 * Q48 review: every way a Settings setting is changed writes a change record, through the one choke
 * point (recordedWrite, or the kit's own applyWithPins). Two guards hold that:
 *
 * 1. Every setting in the catalogue has a writer below that is run for real, or is named as changed
 *    only through the settings kit, with the reason. Each writer is checked the same way: every
 *    catalogue value that moved while it ran must be in the change records it left, before and after.
 * 2. Every file in src/ that saves or deletes a catalogue setting's record is listed here with what
 *    covers it or why it needs no record, so a new writer fails until it is looked at. Keys worked out
 *    some other way than a string, a constant or a small key builder cannot be read by the scan; the
 *    files with such keys are listed too, with what they save.
 *
 * Everything runs on its own data folder; the owner's own Branch is never touched.
