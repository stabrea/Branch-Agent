/**
 * mac7/learn: "Understanding something" -- the map and the guided walk.
 *
 * The seven things that decide whether this was worth shipping, each one failing before the feature
 * existed:
 *
 *  1. a map is built without a model call;
 *  2. a stop with nothing behind it is marked on the stop rather than hidden;
 *  3. a tour asked for in French is written in French, not French chrome round English sentences;
 *  4. a model's broken answer is repaired on the way in rather than taking the tour down;
 *  5. a folder of documents produces a map, not only a folder of code;
 *  6. with the switch off the tools are not advertised and the feature refuses in one sentence;
 *  7. what the work costs is said before any of it is done, and a model with no price never
 *     reports zero.
