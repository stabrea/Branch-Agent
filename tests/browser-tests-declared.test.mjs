/**
 * A test that starts a real browser must say so, or the lane that runs it starts none.
 *
 * The bug this comes from: `tests/browser-session.test.mjs` drove Chromium through Branch's **own**
 * browser tool instead of importing Playwright to steer it. Both selectors decide what a file needs by
 * one signal — a literal `playwright` import — so the file looked like a test that needed nothing. In a
 * full run that is invisible, because every group gets a browser anyway. In the narrow lane it is a red
 * tick reading `Executable doesn't exist`, and an hour spent on a failure that is not a failure.
 *
 * So this does not test behaviour. It reads every test file and asks one question: does it make one of
 * the browser-backed tools run? A file that does and is not in the browser group is an offender BY
 * DEFAULT, and the only way out is EXCUSED below.
 *
 * Two things make that list hard to lean on:
 *
 *   - **the tool names come from the product**, not from a list kept here, so a `browser.pdf` added
 *     tomorrow is covered the day it is written;
 *   - **an excuse is about a line, not a file.** The excused lines must be exactly the lines in the
 *     file — no more, no fewer. A file that gains a real call cannot hide behind an excuse written for
 *     the fake one beside it.
