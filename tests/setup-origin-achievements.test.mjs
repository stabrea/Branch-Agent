/**
 * Setup polish 2: "how am I getting achievements when I am still in onboarding". What the window's setup asks for
 * (sent with `x-branch-origin: setup`) is first-run configuration: switching Devices on to pair a phone is not
 * "Rule maker", a first Trunk introducing itself is not a finished task, a conversation or a Trunk turn, and the look
 * picked there is not a theme worn. A look from setup celebrates nothing. Once setup is over, the same things count.
