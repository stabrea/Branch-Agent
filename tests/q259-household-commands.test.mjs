/**
 * Q259: a household person at the window (the window switched to their profile) acts only on their own things through
 * typed commands and the routes around them.
 *
 * - /stop finds and stops only tasks started for them in their own conversations; the owner's task id reads exactly
 *   like an id that does not exist, and the owner's task keeps working. Their own task stops, by id and bare.
 * - POST /api/commands/run takes their own conversation (lent to the owner while their task works) and refuses the
 *   owner's with the same 404 as a conversation that does not exist.
 * - Every command not listed as theirs is refused at the window; the owner's saved commands are no commands for them.
 *   /sessions, /status, /usage, /memory and /whoami are narrowed to them. The terminal still acts as the owner.
 * - GET /api/policy sends them no policy; GET /api/approvals/categories none of the owner's rules.
 * - GET /api/audit and its spreadsheet, GET /api/usage and its spreadsheet, GET /api/prompts: their own part only.
 * - /inspect, /steps, /trajectory and the Markdown export find only their own; doing a task again is the owner's;
 *   the pairing link, the owner's morning brief and research reports are refused to them.
 * - branch run --preset/--save-preset are refused under Lockdown; --save-preset needs --confirm to loosen;
 *   branch permissions says `branch permissions <name> confirm`.
 *
 * Mutations (each applied to dist/, this file run, the file put back), and the case each turns red:
 *   S1  runsHere: return every owner task for a household person too                     → "cannot stop the owner's task"
 *   S2  runsHere: no task at all for a household person                                   → "stops their own task"
 *   S3  personConversation: drop the lent-conversation branch                             → "stops their own task"
 *   S4  commands api run(): check the conversation against the owner again                → "conversation check"
 *   S5  executeCommand: delete the household command refusal                              → "only their commands"
 *   S6  executeCommand: run the owner's saved commands for a household person            → "only their commands"
 *   S7  householdHere: true on every surface (the terminal too)                           → "terminal acts as the owner"
 *   S8  /sessions: search the owner's tasks again                                         → "narrowed commands"
 *   S9  /status: keep the owner's "When to check with you" line                           → "narrowed commands"
 *   S10 /usage: keep the owner's month                                                    → "narrowed commands"
 *   S11 /memory: read the owner's facts                                                   → "narrowed commands"
 *   S12 GET /api/policy: send the owner's policy to everyone                              → "policy and categories"
 *   S13 GET /api/approvals/categories: the owner's categories to everyone                 → "policy and categories"

 *   S15 the audit spreadsheet: the owner's whole record to everyone                       → "audit"
 *   S16 GET /api/usage: the owner's usage to everyone                                     → "usage and prompts"
 *   S17 GET /api/prompts: the owner's saved prompts to everyone                           → "usage and prompts"

 *   S19 /replay: no owner check                                                           → "task details"
