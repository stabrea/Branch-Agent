/**
 * Q254 (security review): GET /api/runs/:id/stream (SSE) and the run socket /api/runs/:id/ws follow who is at the
 * window, as /api/events/stream does since #339. Each checked the run's owner only when it opened, so a stream or
 * socket opened as the owner on the owner's run kept delivering that run's events after the window switched to a
 * household person. Now, once the window switches, an owner event written after the switch never goes out, and the
 * stream or socket ends by itself with reason "profile". Opening it again as the person is refused (404 / 401); once
 * the window is the owner's again, the owner reopens it and reads their run. Nothing reaches a provider.
 *
 * Mutations that turn this red (each run by hand against a rebuilt dist/, one at a time):
 *  - SSE part: in src/server.ts, drop `{ owner: run.owner, scopeNow: () => app.store.profiles.scope() }` from the
 *    streamRunEvents call on /api/runs/:id/stream (or make `scopeMoved` in streamRunEvents return false). The stream
 *    then delivers "owner.after" to the person's window, failing "no owner event reaches the window on the run stream
 *    after it switched profile".
 *  - WebSocket part: in src/server.ts, drop `owner: run.owner, scopeNow: () => app.store.profiles.scope()` from the
 *    serveRunSocket call in the upgrade handler (or make `inScope` in src/ws.ts return true). The socket then delivers
 *    "owner.after", failing "no owner event reaches the window on the run socket after it switched profile".
