 * Refusing every redirect looked safe and broke the ordinary way of signing in: the form is answered
 * with "now go here", and Branch landed on a browser error page instead of the page it had just signed
 * in to. The existing test — "an allowed site cannot redirect the browser to an unlisted origin" —
 * passed either way, because it only checks that the forbidden website was never fetched. So nothing
 * went red while the guard was far stricter than it meant to be.
 *
 * Local only: two small servers on 127.0.0.1 and a headless browser.
