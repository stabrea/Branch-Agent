/**
 * Q50: a settings request said out loud in a live conversation takes the same path as a typed one.
 * The live model is offered Branch's own settings tools (they used to sit past the 48 tools a live
 * conversation is given, so a spoken "turn on the board" could never reach settings.find), an
 * ambiguous request comes back as one question with nothing planned, and a change is put to the owner
 * with its exact before and after. Nothing here opens a microphone or reaches the internet: the
 * service is a little local WebSocket server speaking OpenAI's documented words.
