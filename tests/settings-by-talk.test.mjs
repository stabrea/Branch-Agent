/**
 * Changing Branch's own settings by asking for it (src/settings-kit/tools.ts): settings.list,
 * settings.change and settings.loosen.
 *
 * What a hostile caller would try, and the test for each:
 *   1. a household profile changing the owner's settings                  → refused before anything is read
 *   2. a short-lived key doing it                                          → refused
 *   3. a chat app doing it, or a helper of a chat's task                   → refused
 *   4. a schedule, a trigger or another program (MCP, A2A) doing it        → refused
 *   5. an ordinary change slipping through with no question                → asked, under every rule set, even "allow everything"
 *   6. the model answering "yes, less careful" by itself                   → never: a less careful change is asked of the owner every time, never kept
 *   7. a change saved around the setting's own save (a tool left behind)   → saved through the window's writers
 *   8. reaching something that is not a setting (a key, a connection)     → refused by name, nothing written
 * Everything runs on its own data folder and a closed port; the owner's own Branch is never touched.
