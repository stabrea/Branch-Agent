/**
 * profile-audit: the app window switched to a household profile is that person.

 * Every route tests/short-lived-key-routes.mjs calls "owner" (and every read it calls a secret) is
 * driven here with the window switched to somebody else's profile, and must meet the one sentence
 * src/server.ts answers at one place. The owner, switched back, must never meet it. A route added
 * later has to be put in that table first (tests/short-lived-keys.test.mjs fails until it is), and
 * then this file decides for it: "owner" is refused here without anybody writing a check, and
 * "other" fails here until src/household-routes.ts lists it as a person's own.
