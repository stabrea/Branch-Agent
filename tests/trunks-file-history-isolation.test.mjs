/**
 * FQ-routing.isolated-agents: files.history and files.restore leaked another Trunk's (or the
 * owner's) exact file content. file_versions kept every version by owner and bare relative path
 * alone, with no column saying which scope wrote it — even though files.checked() already resolves
 * every path against a folder of its own for a Trunk's own turn (.branch-agents/<id>,
 * src/trunks/file-root.ts). A Trunk with files.read could call files.history for a path another
 * Trunk happened to use too (a plausible name like "note.md" or "plan.md") and see that Trunk's
 * exact earlier bytes; files.restore could then write them into its own folder. workspace.snapshot
 * had the same shape from the other direction: it walked the whole shared workspace regardless of
 * who called it, so a Trunk taking a snapshot of "its own work" actually kept every other Trunk's
 * (and the owner's) files too, all stamped with its own scope and so readable back through its own
 * files.history afterwards.
