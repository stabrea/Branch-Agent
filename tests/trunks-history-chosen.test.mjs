/**
 * A conversation the owner hands to a Trunk is that Trunk's to look back on only while it is the one
 * chosen to answer there, and a Trunk's side of a room only while it still sits in that room. Every
 * look into the past keeps the same rule: a search, a read by id, the conversation's shape, a copy of
 * it, cards written up from it, and a task's record. A Trunk taken out of a room stays out of its side
 * after the room is deleted too. Real Trunk turns, a scripted model and the real tools throughout.
