/**
 * surfaces.generation: a picture and a video that were made are real files, and this test opens both.
 *
 * The row stayed partial for a plain reason: the picture fixture was a single pixel nobody ever
 * decoded, and the video fixture was twenty-six bytes beginning with "ftypisom" — enough to look like
 * an MP4 to a check that only reads the first box. Neither proved a person could open what Branch
 * saved.
 *
 * So the stand-in services answer with files that really are what they claim. The picture is built
 * here and compressed properly. The video is a VP9 film kept at `tests/fixtures/two-colours-vp9.mp4` —
 * a red second and a blue second — encoded once, away from this test; nothing here needs ffmpeg on the
 * computer running it.
 *
 * **That paragraph used to vouch for the film itself** — "genuinely encoded", "two seconds", "1,256
 * bytes" — which is prose, and prose goes on being reassuring about whatever bytes are at that path.
 * The claims are checked now instead: its digest and size are pinned, and its container is read back
 * field by field, in the test named for it below. Nothing here describes the fixture that is not also
 * asserted about it.
 *
 * What Branch saved is then opened: the PNG back to its exact pixels, and the video **played by a real
 * browser**, which decodes two frames and hands back their colours. Branch's own reader is asked as
 * well, so the file is readable by the app and not only by this test.
 *
 * Nothing leaves this computer, and no window opens.
