/**
 * household-followups: every owner-only guard inside a tool judges by the person a task was started
 * for, not by whoever the app window is switched to while the task runs.
 *
 * GUARDS lists each tool whose code refuses anybody but the owner, with one tool driven per guard.
 * Each is run three ways through the registry, as a task's own call:
 *   - a household person's task, after the window was switched back to the owner → refused;
 *   - the owner's own task, while the window is switched to a household person → not refused as
 *     "the owner's" (it may still fail for its own reasons: nothing is signed in, nothing connected);
 *   - no task behind the call at all, with the window on the person → refused (the window decides).
 *
 * The last test reads src/ and fails when a file that defines or wires a tool gains an owner check
 * (`requireOwner(` or `.isOwner()`) without being decided here, in GUARDS or NOT_TOOL_GUARDS.
