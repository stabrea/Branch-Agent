/**
 * Never breaks: undoing a bad update without making things worse. The activation journal records
 * what an update actually changed — which files, their fingerprints on both sides, which format
 * changes ran, what the older version could read — and the gate refuses in plain words whenever
 * putting the older version back would cost the owner something.
 *
 * Fake installs and fake data folders in temporary folders only. No real app is launched, nothing is
 * installed, and the owner's own Branch is never touched.
