/**
 * Pass 17 (Timeline and Helpers): GET /api/runs/:id/steps answers one task's steps in order — model calls with their
 * price, tool steps, the questions it stopped on and how they were answered, the helpers it started, the notes the owner
 * steered it with — and each chained step's hash from the activity chain. A helper's question is answered under the same
 * exact-request rules as the main card, and a yes to it never carries the helper on as a task of the owner's own.
 * A scripted model; no provider.
 *
 * Mutation notes (each turns this file red):
 * - src/server.ts settleAsked: drop `&& !origin.parentRunId` and "a yes to a helper's question settles it" fails (the
 *   helper's conversation gains a carry-on task started as the owner's own).
 * - src/run-steps.ts runSteps: drop `...steerSteps(events)` and the "You" step is missing; drop the `.sort(...)` and the
 *   steps come out of order; make chainQueue return null and the tool step's hash is gone.
 * - src/run-steps.ts helpersOf: drop the parentRunId filter and an unrelated task is listed as a helper.
 * - src/runtime.ts: drop the `agent` mark on a helper's run.started and the helper has no name.
