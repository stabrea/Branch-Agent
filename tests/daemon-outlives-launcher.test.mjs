/**
 * The background engine keeps working after whatever started it has gone.
 *
 * This is the one thing the feature ledger's own criterion asks for and nothing proved: installing
 * as a sign-in task, the controlled close and who may close it were all covered, and "start it,
 * close the launcher, see that tasks are still handled" was not. A note on disk is not that proof —
 * the note is written by whatever started, and it says nothing about who is still listening.
 *
 * Nothing here goes near the owner's own Branch. Its own scratch data directory, its own workspace,
 * a port the operating system picks, the offline demonstration provider, and an engine this test
 * starts and this test stops. No window opens.
