/**
 * The card "How Branch runs on this computer" says, in one line, where Branch's own door listens:
 * on every address, on private IPv4 networks only, or on this computer only, and when the door was
 * closed while Branch ran, why, and whether starting Branch again would open it. The line is made
 * from what `GET /api/listen` says, so these tests read that route from a real Branch.
