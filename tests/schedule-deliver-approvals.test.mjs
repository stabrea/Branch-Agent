/**
 * A schedule that sends its result to a chat sends a message to that chat when it runs. So does a page
 * or screen watch that sends its news to a chat, and the morning brief once the chat it goes to is
 * chosen. So the owner's approval settings weigh each of them under "Message people" as well as
 * "Change settings": it is asked about whenever either kind would ask, refused whenever either
 * refuses, and the question put to the owner stays the call's own. It meets what sending that message
 * now would meet, so a rule about that one chat and a conversation mode that asks before a message is
 * sent count as well. One that sends nowhere (a schedule with no chat, a watch whose news stays in the
 * app, a change to the brief that names no chat) is judged exactly as before. Every model here is a
 * scripted fake and every page a made-up one: nothing is sent, nothing is fetched, and no picture of
 * the screen is taken.
