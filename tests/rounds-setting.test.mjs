/**
 * The round limit: how many times one task may go back to the model before it stops and gives the best
 * answer it has. It is the owner's own knob (limits.maxModelRounds), and Branch's own settings tools
 * find it by plain words and change that same knob with the owner's yes. Work on the project's files
 * gets 40 rounds while the owner has set no figure; the owner's figure, once set, wins for every task.
 * A task that runs out of rounds ends with its best answer; one that runs out of steps is not asked again,
 * since that question would be one step too many. Either way it says which limit it met, where to raise
 * it, and that Branch can raise the round limit once the owner says yes.
 *
 * Everything runs on its own data folder with a scripted model; the owner's own Branch is never touched.
