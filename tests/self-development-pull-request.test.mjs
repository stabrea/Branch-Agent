/**
 * Q12: the documented pull request step of a self-development task runs whole or not at all.
 * `github.pull_request_from_changes` pushes `branch/<name>` and then opens the draft with
 * `github.open_pull_request`. The contract must list both, and is asked about both before anything
 * is pushed. Real app, scripted model, a stand-in `git` first on PATH and a stand-in GitHub tool,
 * so nothing reaches a network.
