/**
 * FQ-execution.host-bridge: the owner names a computer explicitly and gets back which computer the
 * program was sent to, right alongside what it said. The Settings card's door
 * (`src/host-bridge-api.ts`, `public/host-bridge.js`) runs `remote.run` through the same hand-pressed
 * gate as "Try a tool" (`/api/tools/try`): Lockdown, the owner's own rules, a household person's
 * role and the secret scrub all apply to it exactly as they do there.
 *
 * No SSH connection is ever made: `RemoteWorkspaces` takes an `SshRun` it calls instead, and the
 * fake here answers by which computer's alias appears on the command line — the only way to prove
 * the identity that comes back really tracks the computer that was asked, rather than being echoed
 * straight from the request. The fake stands behind both `app.remotes` and the registry's
 * `remote.*` tools, so whichever path the door takes, it can only ever reach the fake.
