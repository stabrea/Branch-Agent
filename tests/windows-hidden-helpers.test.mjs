/**
 * CBQ-001: a packaged Windows update must not put a console window on the owner's screen, and closing
 * one helper must not start another.
 *
 * The tests that came before this one assert that the code passes `windowsHide: true`. That is a test
 * of the source, not of the screen, and it passes while a console is really appearing: on Windows
 * `detached: true` and `windowsHide: true` cannot both apply, so the flag is present and ignored. So
 * these tests start the real launchers and then ask Windows which top-level windows exist.
 *
 * A test that only ever reports "no window appeared" is indistinguishable from a blind one, so the
 * first test here makes a console that is meant to be seen and fails if it cannot see it.
