/**
 * Never breaks: the second chaos round — installing, updating and starting up.
 *
 * The first round (never-break-chaos.test.mjs) kills Branch in the middle of a task. This one kills
 * it in the middle of an update, a change to the shape of its saved work, and a first start, and
 * starts it on machines that are already broken. Each seed picks a state to put the saved work in
 * and a moment to cut off, and then the same question is asked every time:
 *
 *   Branch starts, the owner's conversations, settings and memory are all still there, no change to
 *   the shape of the data is half-applied, nothing half-installed is left lying about, and anything
 *   Branch refuses to do it says in a sentence a person can act on.
 *
 * A crash, quiet loss of the owner's work, or a state only a person with a terminal could clean up
 * is a failure. Quick by default (a few seeds, for CI); BRANCH_INSTALL_SEEDS=200 runs the long set.
 * Every seed's choices are printed, so a failing one can be replayed on its own.
 *
 * Only temporary folders, fake releases and fake installs. Nothing is installed on this computer, no
 * real app is launched, no `launchctl`, `systemctl` or real GitHub release is ever touched.
