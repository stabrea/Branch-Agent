/**
 * mac7/vault-autofill (R17-068): filling one of the owner's saved sign-ins into the page they are on.
 *
 * Nothing here calls a real password manager, a real Keychain or a real browser. The manager is a
 * fake runner that records the exact argument array it was handed; the page is a stand-in that
 * records which box it was asked to type into. Every fixture points the Bitwarden command at a name
 * inside a temporary folder that does not exist, so a stray code path could only ever fail to find
 * it — the owner's own vault is never asked anything.
