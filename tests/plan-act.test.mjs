 * person who had just written "there was nobody to say yes while this task ran". A chat person is a
 * person: the chat is handed a `needs_input` answer as the words it is (src/channels/router.ts
 * `finishTurn`), the conversation is written down against that chat, and "go ahead" there picks the
 * plan up. So Plan mode from a chat shows the plan and waits, as it does in the window.
