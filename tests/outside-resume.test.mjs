/**
 * mac7/outside-resume: a task started from outside — a trigger, a schedule, a chat app, MCP, A2A or
 * ACP — keeps that origin however it is carried on, so the 0.18.1 hold (it asks before any change,
 * even under "No approvals") and the chat app's refusals of owner-only actions still apply. Every
 * path in docs/agents/STATUS-outside-resume.md has a test here; the owner's own task is unchanged.
 * A stand-in model and temporary folders only.
