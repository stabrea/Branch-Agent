 * mac7/nodes: what one of the owner's devices can be allowed to do for Branch.
 *
 * The idea is OpenClaw's "nodes" (MIT, see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md): a device dials out to the
 * computer running Branch and offers a short list of things it can do. Branch's version differs in
 * three ways that matter to an owner who is not technical:
 *
 *   - every capability has its own switch on every device, and every switch starts off (the
 *     per-device, per-feature list is the idea KDE Connect made familiar; nothing of its code is used);
 *   - a capability that captures something or runs something asks the owner first even when no
 *     approval rule has been written (see `asksUnlessRuled`, read by src/policy.ts);
 *   - the operating system's own permission prompt only ever appears on the device, and only at
 *     the moment the owner switches that capability on there.
