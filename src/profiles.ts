/**
 * Profiles for a household. Someone else who uses this computer can be given their own named
 * profile with a PIN: their conversations and what the assistant remembers for them are kept apart
 * from the owner's, and they cannot reach the owner's saved secrets or projects. This is separation
 * on one computer, not separate accounts: it does not sync anywhere, and anyone who can open the
 * files on this machine can still read everything. The PIN keeps profiles apart, it does not lock
 * the data away.
 *
 * household-followups: going back to the owner needs no PIN unless the owner sets one (Settings →
 * People; off out of the box). With it set, switching back asks for it, with the same hashing, the
 * same run of five wrong tries and the same refusals as a person's PIN, and the window stays that
 * person's across a restart of the app. That makes the household restriction a lock against
 * somebody at the keyboard, still not against somebody who can open the data folder.
