/**
 * Changing Branch's own settings by asking for it: "turn the wake word on", "switch off the learning
 * core", "which of my settings would help with this?". The owner decides; Branch says what it would
 * change and does it only on the owner's yes.
 *
 *   - `settings.find` takes the owner's own words ("turn the wake word on") and, before anything is
 *     planned, either asks one question — when the words fit several settings or none — or gives the
 *     exact before and after for the one setting they fit, leaving out what is already as asked (Q50).
 *   - `settings.list` reads the catalogue (src/settings-kit/catalogue.ts): every switch, choice and
 *     number the owner can change, with what it is set to now. Nothing else in the settings table —
 *     connections, keys, people, Lockdown — is ever listed or changed here.
 *   - `settings.change` makes ordinary changes. The runtime asks the owner first, whatever the rules
 *     say (`settingsHold`); "yes for this conversation" is remembered like any other answer.
 *   - `settings.loosen` is the only way to make a change that leaves Branch less careful or lets it
 *     reach further. It is asked about every time, a yes is never kept, and the model cannot answer
 *     it: the question goes to the owner. `settings.change` refuses such a change and says so.
 *   - Q49: `settings.why` says who or what last set one setting, from the change records only, and
 *     `settings.undo` puts back one recorded change, asked about first like `settings.change`. An
 *     undo that would leave Branch less careful is refused: that is the owner's, on the Recent
 *     changes card, because the question the owner is shown names only the record, not what it loosens.
 *
 * Every write goes through the same path as the window's presets and settings file (`applyWithPins`,
 * with the same writers), so pins, the audit record and the tools a switch adds or removes all follow.
 * Only the owner, in a conversation they started, gets any of this: a household profile, a
 * short-lived key, a chat app, a lent conversation, a schedule, a trigger or another program is refused
 * before anything is read.
