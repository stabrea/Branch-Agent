 * is no second progress store), who holds it, each member's role, run, status and batch, an open
 * handoff, what blocks it, and its result. Reading it never settles, claims or runs anything: a claim
 * whose turn is gone is shown as blocked until somebody asks about it (Teams.run settles it then).
 *
 * A member whose role names a reviewer says which members it answers after. That comes only from the
 * batches the turn really started ("team.batch.started"): a member in a later batch starts after the
 * earlier batches have finished, while one in the same batch runs alongside the others and waits for
 * nobody. Either way it is given the task, not the other members' answers.
