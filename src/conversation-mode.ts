/**
 * Redesign phase 1: how much the assistant may do in one conversation, picked from the message box.
 *
 *   ask   Ask first     reading is free; any change, command or web action waits for a yes
 *   plan  Plan          reads and proposes; changes nothing (a change is refused, not asked about;
 *                       a web action is asked about, so Plan is never looser than Ask first)
 *   auto  Auto          changes inside the workspace go ahead; commands and the web ask
 *
 * Q59: a web action is any tool that reaches beyond the workspace (src/tool-reach.ts): it sends a
 * request over the network, or acts on a web page or another program's window. The registry says
 * which tools those are, and Ask first, Plan and Auto each ask before every one of them.
 *   full  Full access   nothing is checked with you (commands no rule covers still ask, as always)
 *
 * The rule that decides what a conversation may do:
 *
 * 1. A conversation with no mode of its own follows the owner's setting, exactly as before. Only a
 *    conversation started in the window after this change is given one (Ask first), so every older
 *    conversation behaves as it did.
 * 2. A mode replaces the preset part of the owner's setting for that conversation. The owner's own
 *    rules that name something (a folder, a website, a remembered command) and every refusal they
 *    wrote still apply; "Ask first" and "Plan" also drop every yes, so they are never looser than
 *    they say.
 * 3. The owner may pick a mode looser than their setting: it is their computer and their choice.
 *    Somebody else in the house never can; their tasks keep the owner's setting when theirs is looser.
 * 4. It sits under everything that was already stronger: Lockdown (only Plan can tighten it further),
 *    the hold on tasks started from outside (a chat app, a trigger, a schedule: never more than Ask
 *    first), roles, the protected areas and the other guards in src/runtime.ts `checkPolicy`.
