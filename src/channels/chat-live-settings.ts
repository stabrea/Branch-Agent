/**
 * The owner's switches for the chat-app extras. Each one is on, off, or "when needed", and each one
 * starts off: a fresh install answers chat messages exactly as it always did.
 *
 * - `liveStatus`: typing, a reaction on your message, and a progress message edited in place.
 *   "When needed" shows nothing for a quick answer and starts all three only once a task has been
 *   working for a few seconds.
 * - `commands`: /stop, /status, /new, /compact, /usage, /btw, /help. "When needed" reads only the
 *   ones that matter while a task works (/stop, /status, /btw, /help), and only while one does;
 *   otherwise a message starting with "/" is an ordinary message.
 * - `steering`: a message sent while a task works is handed to it as a note. "On" also answers
 *   quick messages as one; "when needed" steers without waiting to gather. Off, a message for a
 *   busy chat waits for the task to finish and is then answered on its own.
 * - `splitting`: long replies are split at paragraph breaks and never leave a code block open.
 *   "When needed" does that only for a reply that contains code; off splits as before.
 *
 * These are chat-side behaviours with nothing to put in front of the model, so "when needed" is
 * decided by the situation (a slow task, a busy chat, code in the reply) rather than by the tool
 * tiering of src/tool-loading.ts.
