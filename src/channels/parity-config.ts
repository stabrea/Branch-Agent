 * How the chat services added in wave mac3 are written in the connections file and built. The
 * launcher (src/integrations/bootstrap.ts) knows only two things about them: the shape below, which
 * joins its list of channel shapes, and `buildParityChannel`, which it calls for any of them.
 *
 * Each service checks the rest of what the owner wrote with its own strict shape, so a mistyped
 * setting is refused by name when Branch starts rather than ignored.
