/**
 * mac7/chat-allowlist: what a task started by a chat message may use.
 *
 * This used to be a list of things taken away, which meant anything nobody had thought to name was
 * handed over — including the screen and keyboard, running code and stopping programs, and every
 * permission added after the list was written. It is now the other way round: a chat's task gets
 * the short list below and nothing else, so a permission added tomorrow is refused until somebody
 * decides otherwise.
 *
 * The short list is what a conversation needs to read and answer: ask the person a question, read
 * files, read what Branch remembers, look something up on the web, and read the instructions of an
 * installed skill. Searching is not its own permission — searching files is `files.read`, searching
 * memory is `memory.read`, and searching the web is `web.read`. Every one of them only looks:
 * `isReadOnlyPermission` in src/policy.ts holds for all five, and `tests/chat-allowlist.test.mjs`
 * checks that it still does.
 *
 * Integration review (mac7/chat-allowlist): `skills.read` is on the list because a skill is
 * instructions a task reads, not power it gains. Loading one hands the model words; every tool the
 * words name is still checked against this same list when it is called (`ToolRegistry.execute`), so
 * a skill can describe running a command and the command is still refused. Without it, "/commands"
 * and every skill the owner installed quietly stop working over chat, with no message saying why.
