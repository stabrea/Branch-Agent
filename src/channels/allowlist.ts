 * Batch 20 (wave 8): one list of who may talk to the assistant, for every chat app at once.
 *
 * Each channel already carried a list of its own, which meant the same answer had to be given
 * separately for Telegram, for Slack, for email, and remembered in as many places. This is the one
 * shape: a rule names a channel (or every channel) and a sender (or every sender on it), and says
 * whether they are let through or turned away. Turning away wins over letting through, so a single
 * "never this person" rule cannot be undone by a broader one somewhere else in the list.
 *
 * The per-channel lists still work and are read as well, so nothing an owner already set up stops
 * working the day they update.
