/**
 * mac5/manual-actions: the one gate a tool run outside a conversation goes through
 * (`Runtime.executeTool`). A conversation's own calls keep their gate in the runtime; this is for
 * the rest — a tool pressed by hand in the app window, the code editor's save, a saved workflow's
 * step, a flow box, a live voice call, the pull-request hook.
 *
 * - "owner": the owner pressed it in the app window, so the owner is the one asking and an
 *   "ask first" rule they wrote does not stop it. Everything else still does: a refusing rule,
 *   Branch's own files (never-break), Lockdown and an untrusted folder for anything that changes
 *   something, and the sandbox a rule asks for.
 * - "policy" (the default, so a caller that forgets is held, not let through): work that runs by
 *   itself is held exactly as a task is — "ask" comes back as `ApprovalRequiredError`, bound to the
 *   exact bytes, for the caller to put to the owner.
 *
 * A short-lived key is not the owner at the window: in "owner" mode it is held to the full rules, so
 * only "allow" runs and every refusal names the key (mac5/key-sweep, one gate for both).
 *
 * The leak guard is not the owner's rule to skip either: an address carrying a key or password stays
 * a question ("Try a tool" puts it) and, where nothing can put it, a refusal.
