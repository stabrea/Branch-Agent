/**
 * The shapes the security self-check works with. Every check is a pure function over one
 * `SecuritySnapshot`, which is gathered once (src/security-audit/collect.ts); nothing a check does
 * touches the disk, the network or a program, so every check can be tested on every system.
 *
 * The idea of one list of named checks, each with a severity and an optional repair, comes from
 * OpenClaw's `src/security/audit.ts` (MIT). The checks themselves are Branch's own: each is decided
 * from something Branch actually stores or a file that actually exists.
