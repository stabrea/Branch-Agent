/**
 * The two switches of the security self-check. Both ship off.
 *
 * `audit` — off: the check runs only when you ask for it (the button, or `branch security audit`).
 * When needed: the assistant also has one read-only tool, `settings.security_check`, and uses it when
 * the work calls for it ("is my setup safe?"). On: the check also runs by itself each time Branch
 * starts, so the Settings card opens on a fresh answer.
 *
 * `malware` — off: nothing is looked up. When needed: a package an outside server is fetched from is
 * looked up in the public malware list the first time Branch starts it, and the answer is kept for a
 * week. On: it is looked up again whenever the last answer is more than an hour old.
