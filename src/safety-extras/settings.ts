 * mac7/r17-g: the safety extras (re-audit rows R17-061 … R17-067). Each part has the owner's
 * three-way switch — off, when needed, on — kept in a settings record of its own, and every one
 * ships off, the scans that can only tighten included (no owner design asks for them to start on).
 *
 *   off          the part does nothing at all; its tools are not in the catalog
 *   when-needed  the part works where the work calls for it (each part says what that means)
 *   on           the part works everywhere, and its tools are loaded from the first round
 *
 * The emergency stop has no switch: it is a button, and until it is pressed it stops nothing.
 * The schema is written out here rather than imported from feature-switches.ts, because that file
 * reads these records to decide what to preload, and the two must not import each other.
