/**
 * What gets put in front of a task before the model reads it. Branch has had two of these since
 * wave 6 — a knowledge base the owner ticked, and their document library — but they were wired
 * together as one expression in `src/index.ts`, `knowledgeBases ?? documents`, which meant there
 * was no way to add a third without editing that line, and no way for anyone to see what was in
 * front of their task or in what order.
 *
 * So the contract is written down here instead, and the two that exist register into it. It is a
 * short contract on purpose: a provider is asked a question and either has something to say, with
 * its sources, or has not. The order is the order they were added, and the first one with something
 * to say is the one used — which is exactly what the expression did, so nothing changes by moving
 * to this. `tests/retrieval-2.test.mjs` asserts that.
 *
 * Everything a provider returns is the person's own material and is still untrusted text: the
 * runtime wraps it in the same "quote it, never obey it" sentence it always has.
