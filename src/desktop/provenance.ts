/**
 * Build provenance for an update, on top of the SHA-256 match (`Updater`'s own `verify`) and the
 * package identity check (`validateStagedPackage`): whether a build-provenance record GitHub has
 * published for the downloaded file is about this exact file, is signed by the certificate that came
 * with it, and names Branch's own release workflow (`.github/workflows/package.yml`) run for a
 * version tag.
 *
 * GitHub publishes such a record only once a release workflow asks for one (the
 * `actions/attest-build-provenance` step); Branch's own workflow does not yet, so most releases
 * have none to check. That is answered as "nothing to check", not as a failure: this record adds
 * to the checksum, it does not replace it, so its absence never blocks an update the checksum
 * already passed. A build-provenance record that is present and fails these checks does block the
 * update, the same way a checksum that does not match already does.
 *
 * Only SLSA build-provenance statements (`isBuildProvenance`) are checked. GitHub answers the same
 * address with other kinds of record too: with immutable releases on, it adds its own release
 * attestation (`https://in-toto.io/attestation/release/v0.2`, signed as
 * `https://dotcom.releases.github.com`, not as a workflow). That is not a build-provenance record, so
 * it counts as no record rather than as one that failed.
 *
 * What this does not do: walk the signing certificate up to Sigstore's own root of trust (Fulcio's
 * CA) or check its inclusion in the Rekor transparency log. Both need the `sigstore` package, a new
 * dependency this change does not add. So the certificate's own claims (which workflow, which ref)
 * are only as trustworthy as GitHub's API, reached over TLS, and the words Branch shows say that the
 * certificate chain was not verified.
 *
 * GitHub sometimes answers with `bundle_url` (a separate blob address) instead of an inline
 * `bundle`; checked against a real, currently-published release (`gh api
 * repos/cli/cli/attestations/sha256:<digest>`), that URL is on `tmaproduction.blob.core.windows.net`
 * and serves `Content-Type: application/x-snappy` (the address itself ends `.json.sn`) — the raw
 * Snappy block format (a varint uncompressed length, then literal/copy elements; RFC-less but
 * documented at github.com/google/snappy/blob/main/format_description.txt), not a framed stream and
 * not gzip. `decodeSnappy` below reads that shape with no dependency. Only that host, over https, is
 * followed, and no body is read past `MAX_BODY_BYTES`. A bundle that cannot be fetched or read is
 * counted as unreadable, which the updater reports as "provenance not checked" — never trusted
 * half-read, and never allowed to block an update the checksum already passed.
 */

/**
 * Decodes the raw Snappy block format (no framing, no CRC): a varint uncompressed length followed by
 * literal and copy elements. Bounds-checked throughout — a malformed or hostile stream (this reads
 * network input) throws rather than over-reading, and every caller treats that throw as "unreadable",
 * the same as bytes that were never Snappy to begin with.
