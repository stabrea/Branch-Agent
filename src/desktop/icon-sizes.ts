 *  - the window (and with it the taskbar button on Windows and the dock on Linux) wants a big mark;
 *  - the menu bar on macOS wants a small one drawn from its shape alone, so it suits a light and a
 *    dark menu bar equally; the notification area on Windows and Linux wants a small ordinary one;
 *  - the dock on macOS is never taken from the window at all. It comes from the `.icns` inside the
 *    bundle (see scripts/package-macos.mjs), which is why nothing here sets it.
