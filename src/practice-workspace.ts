 * about. It is an ordinary project whose folder happens to be made for them, so leaving it is one
 * click back to the folder they were using before.

Nothing in this folder is real. It was made so you can watch Branch Agent work
before you point it at your own files.

Things worth trying:

- "What is in this folder?"
- "Read notes/meeting-notes.md and tell me what I agreed to do."
- "Add a line to notes/shopping.txt saying we need more coffee."
- "Which of these files mentions the invoice?"

When you are ready, choose "Use my real folder" and this workspace stays behind,
untouched, in case you want to come back to it.

Next catch-up: the Tuesday after next.
