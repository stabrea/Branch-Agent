 * somebody else using this computer under their own profile, to a Trunk, and to work a schedule or
 * a trigger started; and it is refused outright while Lockdown is on. Even for the owner it always
 * asks first: the plan is shown — what, from where, how big, how it is checked — and only the exact
 * plan they agreed to is carried out.
