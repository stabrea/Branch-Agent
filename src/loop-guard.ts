/**
 * Noticing when a task is going round in circles (audit A1769, A1713).
 *
 * A model that is stuck tends to do one of two things: ask for the same tool with the same
 * arguments again and again, or bounce between two or three calls (read, write, read, write).
 * The guard watches every call a task makes and answers in three steps that get firmer:
 *
 *  1. warn  — the call runs, and a plain sentence is put beside its result;
 *  2. block — the call does not run, and the model is told why in the same words a person would use;
 *  3. stop  — after repeated blocks the task ends with one sentence the owner can read.
 *
 * A call that also keeps giving back exactly the same result is blocked sooner: that is the
 * clearest sign the approach is not working. Tools that are meant to be asked again and again
 * (a program's output, a status, a list) get gentler limits.
 *
 * The shape follows OpenFang's `loop_guard.rs` (MIT or Apache-2.0) and Gemini CLI's
 * `loopDetectionService.ts` (Apache-2.0); see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md. Nothing here reads the
 * argument text to decide whether a call is a poll: that would let the text relax the guard.
