/**
 * Scorers: the small, repeatable judgements an evaluation makes about one finished task.
 *
 * Every scorer answers the same question in the same shape — `score(task, trajectory, answer)`
 * gives back a number from 0 to 1, a pass or fail, and the reasons in plain words — so a suite, a
 * benchmark and a study can all be graded by the same pieces. All but one of them decide without
 * asking a model, which is what makes a result something two people can check against each other.
 * The one that does ask a model ("rubric") is off unless a connection has been chosen, and its
 * answer is remembered so the same question is never paid for twice in one study.
