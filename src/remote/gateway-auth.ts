/**
 * Batch 20 (wave 8): what a phone has to satisfy before the extra door lets it in.
 *
 * Branch already had three separate answers to "who is this": the local key, the pairing code, and
 * whichever chat app had approved the sender. For the door that faces the private network the owner
 * should be able to say "the key AND this exact phone", not pick one. So the checks are written as
 * a chain of named steps and every step in it must pass. Adding a step can only make the door
 * harder to open, never easier, which is the property that makes a chain safe to configure.
 *
 * The steps:
 *   - `token`   the same local key the window on this computer uses. Already checked before this
 *               runs; it is in the chain so the list reads as the whole truth.
 *   - `pairing` at least one phone has been let in on this computer. It is a switch, not a check on
 *               who is calling; the step that tells one phone from another is `device`.
 *   - `device`  the phone must send back the secret it was given when it paired, so a key copied
 *               off one phone is no use on another.
 *
 * Signing in through somebody else's identity service (OIDC, a social login) is deliberately not
 * one of the steps: there is one owner, the door faces their own private network, and adding an
 * outside company to the path a phone takes to reach this computer would make it less private,
 * not more. See docs/configuration.md.
