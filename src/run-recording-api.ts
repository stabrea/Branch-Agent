 *   POST /api/recordings                      changes the switch or the picture setting
 *   GET  /api/runs/:id/recording              one task's recording, as JSON
 *   GET  /api/runs/:id/recording/page         the same as a page to save and play anywhere
 *   GET  /api/runs/:id/recording/path         the picture of the path it took, as SVG
 *   GET  /api/runs/:id/recording/flow         the workflow it would make; POST saves it
 *   GET  /api/runs/:id/monitor?after=N        boxes, exchanges and words used, since event N
 *   GET  /api/event-loop                      whether Branch is keeping up; POST changes its switch
 *
 * Every route answers only for the profile that is switched on, and a task that is not theirs is
 * "not found". Everything leaving passes through the runtime's secret remover.
