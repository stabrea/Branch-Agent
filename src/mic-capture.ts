/**
 * mac7/live-voice: the microphone, on its own, away from anything that uses it.
 *
 * Everything here was written for the word that starts a turn (mac7/wake-mic, mac7/wake-mac) and
 * lived inside it. It is here now because a second thing needs exactly the same sound — sixteen
 * thousand samples a second, two bytes each, one channel, from a recording program the owner
 * already has — and wants it held open rather than taken one window at a time. The two are the same
 * table of programs and the same discipline for starting one, with two ways of ending it, so this
 * file owns both and neither feature owns the other.
 *
 * What is true of every program started here, whichever uses it:
 *
 *   • it is given **none** of this computer's own environment, so nothing of the owner's can leak
 *     into it, and its full path is looked up here rather than left to a PATH it does not have;
 *   • it is given its arguments one at a time, never a line for a shell to read;
 *   • **no file name is ever an argument**: the sound goes to standard output and nowhere else;
 *   • its own error output is ignored rather than read, so nothing it prints is ever kept;
 *   • it is asked to stop, and ended for good two seconds later if it will not go.
