/**
 * What `branch` answers to, set beside Hermes Agent's `hermes` and OpenClaw's `openclaw` (both MIT;
 * only their command names were read, see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). Each row says whether the Branch
 * command was built in wave mac3, already existed, lives in the window at a named home (and is
 * reachable from the terminal view by that name), or does not apply, and why. The table is data so
 * `docs/configuration.md`, the tests and the coming command catalog can all read the same rows.
