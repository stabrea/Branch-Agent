/**
 * Where saved facts are kept. There are two places now — the app's own SQLite database, and
 * whatever outside memory service the owner has pointed Branch at instead (src/memory-provider.ts)
 * — and this describes what a place has to do, so a second one has something to be built against
 * rather than a guess. It is deliberately small: six things, all of which the existing store
 * already does.
 *
 * The contract, in full:
 *
 * - `read` gives back the fact with that identifier, or nothing. It never throws for a fact that is
 *   not there; "not there" is an answer.
 * - `list` gives back every fact for that owner, newest change first. A backend may cap how many it
 *   returns, but it must say so in its own documentation rather than silently truncating a count.
 * - `write` saves a fact under an identifier the caller chose, replacing what was there. It must
 *   keep `createdAt` from the earlier version and move `revision` on by one, so an edit can be
 *   told from a new fact. Every field of the data is stored as given, including `kind`, `layer`,
 *   `project` and the timestamps that say when a fact was true.
 * - `search` matches on the fact's words at the least. A backend that can also compare by meaning
 *   may, but it must never return a fact the reader is not allowed to see.
 * - `forget` removes one fact and says whether there was one to remove.
 * - `count` says how many facts an owner has, which is what the capacity limit is checked against.
 *
 * Every method is async: a backend that lives on this computer answers at once, and one that is an
 * outside service answers over the network, and a caller must not have to know which. Two rules
 * hold for every backend regardless. Owners never see each other's facts: every call takes an owner
 * and must scope to it. And nothing is written anywhere but this computer unless the owner has
 * asked for that plainly, by switching a memory provider on in Settings — src/memory-provider.ts is
 * exactly that: a drop-in that replaces this one rather than only sitting beside it.
