/**
 * R17-068, the credential vault, as the owner settled it: **filling only**.
 *
 * Branch types a saved sign-in into the page the owner is on, when the owner asks for it by name.
 * It keeps no password of its own: the value is read out of the password manager the owner already
 * uses (src/credential-cli.ts), goes straight into the box on the page, and is dropped. It is never
 * returned to the model, never written into a result, an event, the record of what the assistant
 * was allowed to do, a trace, a log or an error message. The model is told one thing: that a
 * sign-in was filled, for which entry, on which address.
 *
 * Three rules hold the shape:
 *   - The owner says which saved item goes with which site, in their own book below. Branch never
 *     guesses an item from what the page says, and refuses when the address does not match the
 *     entry's own site.
 *   - It is the owner's alone. A chat message's task, a short-lived key (which is also how another
 *     computer reaches this one), a household person, a Trunk, work started by a schedule or a
 *     trigger, and Lockdown are each refused in a plain sentence.
 *   - A page reached by following a link is treated as somewhere untrusted content sent Branch: it
 *     is only filled when the owner wrote that exact address down for the entry beforehand.
