 * Asking for an answer in a shape the rest of the app can rely on.
 *
 * A task says what it wants back the same way a tool declares its arguments — a zod object — and
 * zod's own `toJSONSchema` turns that into the small JSON-Schema subset the existing answer check
 * in `delegation.ts` already understands. Nothing new checks answers here: `checkResult` stays the
 * one path, and this adds only the asking and the single re-ask around it.
 *
 * A reply that does not fit is shown its own validation error and asked once more. A second reply
 * that still does not fit is refused in a plain sentence naming what was wrong, because a
 * half-parsed answer the app then builds on is worse than no answer at all.
