/**
 * A change to Branch itself, asked for from a chat app.
 *
 * A chat app cannot prove who is typing, so from a chat Branch's own source can only be asked about:
 * `/improve <what to change>` files a request that holds the words exactly as they were sent, and who
 * sent them, from which app and chat, read from the message itself. Filing never approves anything,
 * never writes or widens a contract, and never runs anything: no task, no Git.
 *
 * Only the owner answers, in the Branch app, through the owner-only routes below. A yes is the owner's
 * own contract creation: the terms the owner writes are prepared exactly as `branch.prepare_source_change`
 * prepares them (`prepareBranchSourceChange`, unchanged), which writes them through `ContractBook` before
 * anything is made and makes the worktree at the contract's commit. From there the contract, its
 * widening rule and the checked publish are the ones every self-development change has. A yes is refused
 * while that tool is not offered (sending Git work to a remote is off). A no closes the request.
 *
 * The requests live in a table of their own that no backup carries, so a restored file cannot plant one.
