/**
 * eng-connectors review 2: the owner's yes to a server of their own is bound to its launch line (command, arguments,
 * folder, secret names), not to the bytes of the program that line runs. Anything inside the workspace can be rewritten
 * by a task that may write there, so a program there could be swapped after the yes and run, unsandboxed, as Branch
 * starts. The same rule own-clis and default-shell hold to: a server is refused when
 * - it would start in a folder inside the workspace (a bare name is then found there first: Windows looks in the
 *   folder before PATH, and `npx` looks in its node_modules/.bin), or a runner is told to move into one: npm/npx
 *   -C/--prefix/-w/--workspace, pnpm -C/--dir, yarn/bun --cwd, uv/uvx --directory/--project, PowerShell
 *   -WorkingDirectory, wsl --cd; or deno is told to read its settings file from there (--config/-c);
 * - its program is inside the workspace (written as a path, or the first match on PATH);
 * - any argument, or the value of a `--name=value` argument, is an existing file inside the workspace; a `file:` URL is
 *   read as the path it names (`node --import file:///…/srv.mjs`), and on Windows so is a WSL `/mnt/<drive>/…` path;
 * - a program that runs a folder (node, python, npx…) is given a workspace folder as the thing to run, found past the
 *   options that take a value first (`node -r x <folder>`, `python -X opt <folder>`);
 * - it runs inline code that names a place inside the workspace: node's -e/--eval/-p/--print, python's -c, deno's
 *   eval, npx's -c, a `data:` URL (`node --import data:text/javascript,…`), or the command string a shell is given
 *   (bash/sh/zsh -c, PowerShell -Command or -EncodedCommand, `cmd /c "…"`);
 * - a package runner (npx, npm, uvx, uv, pip, and `python -m pip|uv|pipx`) is told to take its package from inside
 *   the workspace: --package/-p, --prefix, --from, --with/-w, --with-editable, --spec, and -e/--editable for pip and uv.
 * Every option counts as `--opt=value` or `--opt value`. A program started by another (`cmd /c`, a shell's -c,
 * PowerShell, wsl, `python -m`) is judged by all of these rules too (src/mcp-launch-shapes.ts reads the line).
 * The code, package and folder-option checks read text, not files: they refuse a written mention of the workspace,
 * whether or not it exists yet. Code that builds the path at run time (joined pieces of it, an environment variable,
 * text it decodes itself) is not caught. A shell command string that names the workspace is refused even as data:
 * give a filesystem server its folder as an argument of its own instead.
 * Any other folder argument stays allowed, so a server pointed at the workspace (a filesystem server) still works.
 * Checked when a server is added and again before every start.
