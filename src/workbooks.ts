/**
 * P17-D §3: "Learn this app or workflow", the behaviour-workbook skill. Branch reads an app, a site or a workflow,
 * writes what it MUST do (one behaviour each), derives checks for every point, runs them on the real thing, and saves
 * a workbook the owner reviews: each MUST marked pass, fails or not proved, with what really happens.
 *
 * A learning run is an ordinary task in its own conversation, started by the owner's own click. It is sealed
 * (src/runtime.ts, `learningRules`):
 *   - it may use only LEARN_TOOLS (reading pages, clicking and typing in Branch's own browser, and `workbook.save`);
 *     every other tool is refused, whatever it was granted: no upload, files, clipboard, messages, spending,
 *     commands, settings, desktop or devices;
 *   - every browser step asks the owner, once, each time: no standing or earlier yes answers it, and no "always"
 *     is offered;
 *   - nothing of the owner's goes into its conversation (no memory, facts, files, skills or instructions), and
 *     nothing it read is learned from.
 * A check that would send, buy or delete is written down and marked not proved.
 * Everything a workbook says came from outside and is kept as data. "Make it a skill" writes a skill from it, scanned
 * like any drafted skill, installed switched off so the owner reviews it first.
 *
 * The feature ships on (it costs nothing until the owner starts one). Kept in `governance` under `workbook:<id>`.
