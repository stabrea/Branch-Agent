 * R17-018: `/subgoal` — more that must be true before a conversation's goal (goal mode, src/goal-mode.ts)
 * counts as done. Each one is shown to the next round word for word, and the judge is asked about
 * the goal and every sub-goal together.
 *
 *   /subgoal <text>      adds one (at most 8, each at most 300 characters)
 *   /subgoal             lists them
 *   /subgoal remove <n>  takes one away
 *   /subgoal clear       takes them all away
 *
 * They are kept beside the goal rather than inside it, so a round finishing never writes over one
 * added while it was working. The command follows Hermes Agent's `/subgoal` (MIT); the code is Branch's.
