/**
 * R17-B: the one way anything in this folder starts a task by itself.
 *
 * - It is a task like any other (`Runtime.run`), marked as started by a schedule, so the owner's
 *   approval rules are capped exactly as for a timed job and an "ask first" rule stops it to wait.
 * - Its steps and tokens are bounded (Settings › Automations, "Limits"), and every part together may
 *   start only so many turns a day; each item has its own daily count and its own gap as well.
 * - Its permissions are never wider than what the owner holds now: `narrowed` keeps only those, and
 *   never the ones that make or change schedules or settings, install anything, or propose more
 *   automations. Every turn is narrowed here, whoever asked for it.
 * - Nothing starts while Lockdown is on, and `cancel` stops the turns that are working (a part
 *   switched off, or Lockdown turned on).
