 * Bucket R17-B: "it suggests, and runs things on its own". Each part has the owner's three-way
 * switch — off, when needed, on — kept in a settings record of its own, and every one ships off.
 *
 *   off          the part refuses in one plain sentence; its tools are not in the catalog at all, and
 *                nothing of it runs by itself
 *   when-needed  it works; its tools are a line in the index, and what it adds to a task's
 *                instructions is one line saying where to read the rest
 *   on           it works; its tools are loaded from the first round, and its instructions are given
 *                in full
 *
 * The mode schema is written out here, as src/asks/settings.ts does, because feature-switches.ts
 * reads these same records and the two must not import each other.
