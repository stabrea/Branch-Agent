 * Bucket R17-D (wave mac7): "coding polish". Each part has the owner's three-way switch — off, when
 * needed, on — kept in a settings record of its own. What each ships as is `codingShipsOn` below; a
 * saved record that cannot be read is off.
 *
 *   off          the part does nothing and refuses in one plain sentence; its tools are not listed
 *   when-needed  it works, and its tools are a line in the index until the work calls for them
 *   on           it works, and its tools are loaded from the first round
 *
 * The schema is written out here rather than imported from feature-switches.ts, because that file
 * reads these same records to decide what to preload, and the two must not import each other.
