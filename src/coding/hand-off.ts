/**
 * Handing a coding job to Claude Code or Codex, the programs the owner signed in to with their own plans, so the
 * work is done by the program itself inside one folder: it reads and edits there (Codex may also run its checks), and Branch gets
 * back what it did. Elsewhere Branch only asks these programs for words (src/providers/cli-agent.ts,
 * src/asks/codex-app-server.ts, both read-only); this is the one door where they may change files, and it is
 * held three ways:
 * - Each program's own limits: Codex runs with `--sandbox workspace-write` in the folder; Claude Code runs with
 *   `--permission-mode acceptEdits` in the folder and runs no commands at all (no allowed commands, Bash refused, and
 *   none of the folder's own settings, hooks or MCP servers loaded), since nothing walls its commands in the way Codex's
 *   sandbox does (NAS 22aa6e3, 454af77, Mac mini 2e70eda). The checks are run afterwards through Branch's own held tools.
 * - Branch's own check afterwards: every file the job changed is listed against where it started, and inside
 *   Branch's own source (a self-development worktree) anything outside the contract's allowed paths is put back
 *   and named, so the contract holds whatever the program did. Sending still goes through the contract's push check.
 *   That check runs Git in the folder, so if the job rewrote the folder's own Git settings (its config, the files
 *   that config pulls in, its attributes or its hooks) Branch runs no more Git there: nothing is checked or kept,
 *   and the owner is told. The owner's own global and system config is untouched, so their sign-in stays.
 * - It is the owner's sign-in, so a Trunk or somebody else on this computer never reaches it.
