/**
 * mac7/speed — doing more in one round.
 *
 * On a hosted model a task's clock is very nearly (how many times it goes back to the model) times
 * (how long a round trip takes): measured on this branch, 88–94% of a coding task's wall time is
 * waiting for the model, and packing the same tool calls into fewer rounds cut one task from 1,958
 * ms to 928 ms. So this part is about rounds, not about making anything in Branch run faster.
 *
 * Four things, all switched together by the `fewer-rounds` coding part, which ships off:
 *
 *   - the tools a coding task always reaches for are loaded from the first round, so it never
 *     spends a round trip searching for `files.edit` before it can start;
 *   - the assistant is told, in one line, that it may ask for several independent things at once;
 *   - `files.read_many` reads several files in one call (registered by the part's own switch, so
 *     "when needed" leaves it a line in the index and "on" loads it from the first round);
 *   - calls in one reply that only look at things run at the same time rather than one after
 *     another (`parallelGroups`, below).
 *
 * Like `read-first`, the behaviour is the same in "when needed" and "on" — there is no useful
 * middle setting for how a loop behaves. What the two modes really choose is the tier its tool
 * travels in, which is the ordinary meaning of the switch.
 */

/**
 * What a coding task reaches for, in the order it usually does. Measured over five ordinary coding
 * requests (`experiments/speed/catalog-probe.mjs`): 14 of these 30 places were a search away rather
 * than described in full, and one request ("Add a --verbose flag … and document it in the README")
 * was shown **none** of the six. With this list loaded it is 1 of 30.
