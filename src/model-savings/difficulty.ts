 * R17-047: choose the connection by how hard the task is. A small model is asked one short
 * question ("easy or hard?") and its answer picks the easy or the hard connection. The idea comes
 * from gemini-cli's classifier routing (Apache-2.0); the wording and code here are Branch's own.
 *
 * "On" asks for every new task. "When needed" first uses the free length-and-tools reading from
 * src/local-routing.ts and only asks the model when that reading cannot tell. The question costs a
 * little, so the card says so, and answers are kept for a while so the same words are not asked twice.
