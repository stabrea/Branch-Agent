/**
 * R17-050: keep a Claude connection's prompt cache warm while the owner pauses. The idea is
 * aider's `warm_cache` (Apache-2.0); this is Branch's own code.
 *
 * Nothing happens unless the owner switched it on. After each answered round of a task the same
 * request is scheduled to be sent again, asking for a single token, after the chosen number of
 * minutes. It stops at the chosen number of pings or before a ping would take the pause past its
 * spending cap, whichever comes first, and a new round starts the count again. A ping is priced at
 * the full input price before it is sent (the cache usually makes it cheaper), and one whose price
 * is not known is never sent, because then the cap could not be kept. Every ping is counted in the
 * task's usage and written down as an event.
