/**
 * The plain Terms line on each accounts list, and the reasoning behind the design. Read at the
 * primary sources on 2026-09-17; docs/configuration.md ("Several accounts per connection") has the
 * full decision with quotes.
 *
 * - OpenAI: its terms forbid "circumvent[ing] any rate limits or restrictions"
 *   (https://openai.com/policies/row-terms-of-use/, the page refuses automated reads, so this is the
 *   search index's copy), and API rate limits are set per organization and project, not per key
 *   (https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rate-limits).
 * - Anthropic: "You may not share your Account login information, Anthropic API key, or Account
 *   credentials with anyone else" (https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms); the usage policy
 *   forbids getting round a ban with another account (https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup); other
 *   apps may not handle Claude.ai sign-ins (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance).
 * - Google: "You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations"
 *   (https://developers.google.com/terms); reusing Gemini CLI's sign-in from other software is a
 *   violation (https://geminicli.com/docs/resources/tos-privacy/).
 * - GitHub: "One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account", and "a single
 *   login may not be shared by multiple people"
 *   (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service).
 *
 * So: keys the owner holds move on to the next key automatically, always waiting out the service's
 * Retry-After, and the card says a key made only to multiply a limit is not allowed. Sign-in
 * accounts never switch by themselves unless the owner turns that on beside this line, and even then
 * never between the owner's own plans of one service — only to an account marked kept separate
 * (someone else's, or work's; mac7/account-pooling, owner decision 2026-09-19). They are never
 * shared with other people on this computer.
