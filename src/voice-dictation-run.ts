/**
 * mac7/live-voice: the microphone open, and let go of again. This is the whole of the hard part.
 *
 * The word that starts a turn takes one window at a time, and letting go of the microphone is a
 * consequence of the recorder ending by itself. Nothing here ends by itself, so every one of those
 * ways out has to be built rather than inherited:
 *
 *   • **the person stops** — pressing Dictate again, or Escape;
 *   • **a quiet room** — nobody has spoken for the seconds the owner chose, so the phrase is ended
 *     and so is the program that holds the microphone;
 *   • **Lockdown coming on, or the switch going off** — asked about before every piece of sound,
 *     and on a tick besides, so a silent microphone is asked about too;
 *   • **Branch being locked** — a state, asked about on the same two beats, so a settings file, a
 *     preset or another window cannot reopen the microphone underneath the lock;
 *   • **the app closing**;
 *   • **the speech program dying** — which is a stop, not something to paper over: the microphone
 *     is let go of, the words are settled, and it is not started again by itself.
 *
 * Nothing here opens a microphone without a press, whatever the switch says. And nothing here is
 * ever written to disk: what is held is the current phrase's words and, on the one path where
 * Branch is handed sound at all, twenty milliseconds of it at a time, overwritten in place.
