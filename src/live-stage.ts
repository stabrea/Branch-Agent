/**
 * live-stage: what the window's full-size view of Branch's browser shows while a conversation's task works in it.
 *
 * Nothing runs here and nothing is kept on disk. While one of the conversation's tasks has its own browser window
 * open, each read takes one frame of the tab it works in (BranchBrowser.watch: a small JPEG with password boxes
 * covered), with the page's address and title, the tabs beside it, and what the task is doing now in the words the
 * activity feed uses. The window reads it about twice a second while the view is open, which makes the live view.
 * The browser window closes when its task ends; the last frame read is then kept in memory only, for a few
 * conversations, so the view can still show where the task finished until Branch restarts.
 *
 * The owner's alone: a household person and every short-lived key are refused before this runs
 * (src/short-lived-keys.ts ownerOnlyReads, src/household-routes.ts fails closed), and the conversation must be the
 * owner's own. A window borrowed in the owner's own browser (browser.borrow) is never pictured. Every word that
 * comes back (addresses, titles, the step) is passed through the saved-secret scrubber and the leak guard.
 *
