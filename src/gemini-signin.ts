 * Signing in with a Google account to use Gemini, instead of pasting an API key.

 * What is honestly true here, and is repeated in the documentation: Google's Generative Language
 * API accepts an API key from anybody, but it accepts a signed-in person's token only when the
 * request goes to a Google Cloud project that has the API switched on, and it then bills that
 * project. There is no way to check that from this computer without sending a real request, so
 * Branch does not pretend the sign-in will work: it builds the sign-in, puts the token in the
 * ordinary Authorization header, and tells you plainly to fall back to a key if Google refuses.
 * Nothing else in Branch uses Google sign-in; this is only for Gemini.
