/**
 * Q59: whether a tool reaches beyond this computer's workspace, classified by what the tool does.
 *
 *   local     it works on the workspace, Branch's own records, or reads something on this computer
 *   outbound  it sends a request over the network (a website, a mail or calendar service, another
 *             computer or device, an outside memory or model service a tool of its own talks to),
 *             or it acts on a web page or on another program's window
 *
 * A request to the owner's own model connection is how Branch thinks, not a web action, so a tool
 * that only asks the model (describing a picture, summarising a document) is local.
 *
 * Ask first, Plan and Auto ask before every outbound tool (src/conversation-mode.ts). The class is
 * worked out from the tool's permission; a tool whose permission does not say enough declares
 * `reach` itself in its definition (src/contracts.ts). A permission missing from the table below,
 * and a tool from somebody else (an MCP server, a plugin, a program lending tools), counts as
 * outbound: Branch cannot see what it does. tests/conversation-mode-order.test.mjs fails while any
 * registered tool's permission is missing here, so a new permission cannot slip through unclassified.
