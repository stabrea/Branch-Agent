 * supplier", where the answer is spread over eight files that never use the same words twice.
 *
 * Honest limits, because this is the part of retrieval most often oversold. The map is built from
 * names that appear in the passages, not from understanding: two spellings of one company are two
 * entries, a name that is also an ordinary word will show up as both, and "mentioned together in
 * the same passage" is the only relation the reader on this computer can find. Where the owner has
 * a model connected and allows it, the model names the relations properly instead; either way every
 * link carries the passage it came from, so nothing here has to be taken on trust.
