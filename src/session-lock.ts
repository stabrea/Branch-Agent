 *
 * App lock: the owner may set a PIN (four to eight digits). While one is set, unlocking asks for
 * it, and a locked Branch answers nothing but its lock status and the unlock itself (`refusal`,
 * checked once in src/server.ts before any route runs). Only a salted scrypt hash is kept, in its
 * own table, which no backup, export or settings file reads. Wrong tries are counted in that same
 * row, so quitting and reopening Branch does not reset them: every fifth wrong try in a row starts
 * a wait, five minutes the first time and twice as long each time after, up to an hour. Changing or
 * removing the PIN asks for the current one and counts towards the same wait.
 * Without a PIN nothing here changes: locking only closes the locker, and unlocking asks nothing.
