/**
 * Bucket 12 (A0776): skills in the open Agent Skills layout (agentskills.io), the folder other
 * agents share: `<name>/SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` in its front matter, and optional
 * `references/`, `scripts/` and `assets/` folders beside it.
 *
 * Reading one turns it into an ordinary Branch skill package, so it goes through the same preview,
 * scan and "arrives switched off" path as every other package (src/skill-packages.ts):
 * - the front matter must meet the Agent Skills rules, which `parseSkillDocument` already checks
 *   (lowercase name with single dashes, at most 64 long; description up to 1024), and the name must
 *   match the folder it sits in, as the layout requires;
 * - text references are kept with the package and, while they fit, added to the instructions,
 *   because Branch gives the assistant one document per skill;
 * - programs in `scripts/` and files in `assets/` are left out and named, never run or unpacked.
 *
 * Writing one does the opposite, so a skill made here can be used by any agent that reads the layout.
