 * The activation journal: what an install or an update actually changed, written down before it
 * happens, so an undo knows exactly what it is undoing. It records, for the version that was there
 * and the version that replaced it, a fingerprint of the files on the disk (a digest over the tree
 * and the place the file system keeps it), which format each database was in on both sides, which
 * format changes ran, the newest format the older version understood, and where the safety copies
 * went. Every step of an undo is appended to the same file as it is attempted, so a rollback cut
 * off half-way still says how far it got.
 *
 * It lives in its own file, `activation.sqlite`, with `synchronous=FULL`, beside the task journal.
 * Every change here keeps `readableBy: 1`, because the version being rolled *back to* has to be able
 * to read it. A file that cannot be read is moved aside and a new one started, exactly as the task
 * journal does, so a torn activation journal can never stop Branch coming up. See
 * docs/never-break.md and the re-audit's A1.
