/**
 * After a restart: what to do with each task that was cut off. Finished steps are never repeated
 * (when the restart came before their result was saved, the conversation is told they finished). A
 * step the model asked for that never started (its intent is in the journal, nothing more) is done
 * now when the task carries on by itself and the approval policy allows it without asking; otherwise
 * the conversation is told it has not been done, so it is asked for again through the usual approval.
 * Steps are settled in order, and once one is left undecided the ones after it are not run. A task
 * whose calls were never written as intents (from a version before them) is handled as before. A step
 * that was in flight is
 *
 * - done again when it changes nothing, or gives the same result however often it runs;
 * - checked when it left something to check (a file's contents, a repository's commit): if it took
 *   effect the conversation says so, and if it did not it is done now;
 * - otherwise put to the owner, because it may already have reached someone ("this may have already
 *   sent the email — check or send again?").
 *
 * Then the task carries on by itself (switch on), or is offered to the owner (when needed). A task a
 * chat app started is left for that app, which sends the message again. See docs/never-break.md.
