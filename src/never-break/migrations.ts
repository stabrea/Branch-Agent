 * Versioned changes to a database's shape. Each change has a way back, and says the oldest data
 * format that can still read the result, so an update can go back one release without losing the
 * owner's work. The rules, in docs/never-break.md:
 *
 * - a change adds; it never renames or drops what the previous release reads, so for most changes
 *   "the way back" is to leave the extra column alone, and `readableBy` stays the old number;
 * - a copy is taken before any change runs (`VACUUM INTO`), and the change runs in one transaction;
 * - a program that finds data newer than it can read stops with a sentence instead of touching it.
