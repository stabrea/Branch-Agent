/**
 * phase2/shell: two switches for the window's frame (docs/configuration.md, "The Trunks strip").
 *
 *   strip    the narrow strip at the left edge (at the foot on a phone) with this computer, your
 *            other computers and your Trunks, each with its own face. A look-and-layout change the
 *            owner asked for (critique #9), so it ships on; switching it off gives the 0.18 window back.
 *   faces3d  procedural 3D stand-ins for the faces of Trunks that ask for one (critique #46). Ships
 *            off: pixel and flat faces are the default, and 3D only draws while this is on.
 *
 *   GET  /api/shell-look   the switches (anyone at the window, a household person included: they only say what to draw)
 *   POST /api/shell-look   { strip?, faces3d? } the owner's alone, at the window
