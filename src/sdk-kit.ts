/**
 * Bucket 21: tools for people building on Branch, behind one three-way switch that ships off.
 *
 *   off          the sdk.* tools are not advertised and refuse; flows cannot be written out or read
 *                back as YAML
 *   when-needed  the tools stay a line in the index until a task asks for them
 *   on           the tools are loaded from the first round
 *
 * The sdk.* tools are what makes Branch's own MCP server (src/mcp-server.ts) an app-builder's
 * server: share them under Customize → Connections and an editor such as Claude Code or Cursor can
 * ask which routes exist, what each one takes, and get working code for each client.
