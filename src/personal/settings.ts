 * R17-C (re-audit 2026-09-17): files, voice, devices and personal connectors. Each part has the
 * owner's three-way switch — off, when needed, on — kept in a settings record of its own, and every
 * one ships off.
 *
 *   off          the part refuses in one plain sentence; its tools are not in the catalog at all
 *   when-needed  it works, and its tools are a line in the index until the work calls for them
 *   on           it works, and its tools are loaded from the first round
 *
 * The schema is written out here rather than imported from feature-switches.ts, because that file
 * reads these same records to decide what to preload, and the two must not import each other.
 *
 * Not here on purpose: live voice in Discord voice channels (R17-023, see docs/configuration.md) and
 * a wake word, which the owner has not yet decided how to build safely.
