 * R17-C integration review: what keeps the owner's mail, calendar, files elsewhere, music and house

 *
 *   - Every personal tool refuses a household profile, a signed-in person and a short-lived key
 *     before it does anything (`ownerOnlyTools`).
 *   - Work the owner did not start themselves — a schedule, a trigger, another AI tool, another
 *     agent — is asked about before any personal tool runs, whatever the rules say, including
 *     "No approvals" (`personalHold`, called from the runtime's policy check).
 *   - A lock, a door, a garage door or an alarm is asked about every time, just this once, for the
 *     owner's own work too.
