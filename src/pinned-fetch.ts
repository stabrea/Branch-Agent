/**
 * A checked request connects only to the addresses its check judged.
 *
 * The network policy looks a site's name up once and judges every address that came back. The
 * request then goes to those addresses and nowhere else: the name is never looked up a second time
 * on the way out. The site's name is kept for the secure handshake, for the certificate check and
 * for the Host line, so the request is the same one it would have been. The platform's `fetch` has
 * no way to be told where to connect, so a checked request is sent here with Node's own http and
 * https, the way the sandbox door (src/sandbox-proxy.ts) sends a program's request to the address it
 * checked. Every connection is a fresh one, so none can carry an address judged for another request.
 *
 * The judged addresses ride along in the request's options under `pinnedTo`, so a wrapper that hands
 * its options on (the size-limited fetch, a model connection's health record) delivers them here.
 * A request without them goes to the platform's fetch unchanged. Each request that arrives here with
 * them is noted, so the network policy can tell when a checked request's fetch did not keep to the
 * checked addresses, and say so.
