 * A measurement is only evidence when two things hold. The first is that the two sides of a
 * comparison were measured the same way: same model choices, same settings, same version of the
 * program, same machine, same tasks, same scorers. The second is that the thing being measured
 * could not reach the thing doing the measuring. This file holds both: the conditions a run has to
 * write down, the refusal that names what differed when two runs did not match, and the fence that
 * keeps a task's own words out of the instructions its judge is reading.
 *
 * Everything here is plain data and plain functions — no store, no model, no network — so a test
 * can pin all of it down. The one exception is `machineIdentity`, which reads this computer's own
 * name and kind, and is written so that the same computer always gives the same short string.
