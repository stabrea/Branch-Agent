 * - off: nothing happens and `github.pull_request_from_changes` refuses;
 * - when-needed: the tool works when the assistant (or the owner) calls it; nothing happens by itself;
 * - on: as well, a task that finishes well and changed files puts exactly those files on a new line
 *   of work called `branch/<task>`, sends it to GitHub and opens a draft pull request.
 *
 * What it never does:
 * - send to the shared branch: the line of work is always a new `branch/…` one, and the base, the
 *   remote's default branch and names such as main, master, develop, trunk or release/* are refused;
 * - act for a short-lived key (`branch token create`): a script's key may not send work anywhere;
 * - put a key anywhere: Git sends with this computer's own sign-in (an address carrying a password
 *   is refused), and GitHub is reached through the saved GitHub tools, whose token is read from the
 *   locker at the moment of the call; the address is checked against the network rules first;
 * - fail quietly: every attempt that stops is written to the task's log with the reason.
