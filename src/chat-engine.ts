/**
 * w911 (A0847): a follow-up question, made whole before your documents are searched.
 *
 * Branch looks in your own documents with the words of the message you just sent. That works for a
 * first question and fails on the second: "and for part-timers?" finds nothing about leave, because
 * the word "leave" was in the question before. The fix other chat engines use is to have the model
 * rewrite the follow-up as a question that stands on its own, and search with that instead. The
 * conversation itself is untouched; only the search changes.
 *
 *   off          the search uses your message as it is (what Branch always did)
 *   when-needed  only a message that reads like a follow-up is rewritten, so a plain question costs nothing extra
 *   on           every message in a conversation with earlier turns is rewritten before the search
 *
 * The rewrite is one short model call with no tools. If it fails, says nothing useful or runs long,
 * your message is used as it is and the task carries on.
