/**
 * Redesign phase 1: the small ring under the message box, and the prompt at 95%.
 *
 * The ring shows how much the tightest connection has left, drawn from the same rows as Settings ›
 * Data & usage › "What each connection has left" and held to the same rule: a share is only ever
 * worked out where a service gave both a limit and a remainder, and never for money, which has no
 * denominator a provider gave us. Where nothing was reported the ring says so and draws no share.
 *
 * The prompt at 95% only asks. Pressing "Save progress" sends each of the owner's running tasks a
 * note through the ordinary steering channel, asking it to write down where it is and what is left.
 * Nothing is paused, stopped or switched: Branch has no pause, and this does not invent one.
