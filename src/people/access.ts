/**
 * Bucket 19: where the two new kinds of key may go. Both lists fail closed: an address not written
 * here is refused, including any added later.
 *
 * - A person's key reaches only the person's own page (`/api/people/me…`, their conversations and
 *   what was shared with them). Everything else in Branch reads the owner's records, so none of it
 *   is on the list, and the profile check in each route is a second wall behind this one.
 * - A set-up key (from the owner's one-time code) reaches only "set a new PIN", "register a passkey",
 *   "who am I" and "sign out".
 * - A key handed to another device for one conversation reaches that conversation, the tasks in it,
 *   and nothing else of the owner's.
