/**
 * Bucket 19: the owner's settings for people signing in from their own device.
 *
 * One three-way switch, off by default. While it is off nothing here answers, and no person's key
 * works. "When needed" and "on" behave the same for this feature: it has no tools for the model, so
 * there is nothing to tier.
 *
 * The sign-in chain says which checks every person must pass, all of them, in order. A profile may
 * be given extra checks of its own on top; it can never be given fewer. OpenID Connect providers
 * (a company or family identity service, or Google, Microsoft or GitLab) prove who somebody is, and
 * only for a profile the owner linked by hand: they never create a profile or pick one.
