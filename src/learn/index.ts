/**
 * mac7/learn: "Understanding something". Point Branch at a folder of code, a knowledge base or a
 * folder of notes and get two things -- a map of what is in there and how the parts connect, and a
 * guided walk through it in plain words.
 *
 * The map is built without a model call, so it costs nothing and nothing leaves this computer. The
 * only model call in the whole feature writes the paragraph on each stop of the tour, it is priced
 * before it is made, and the tour exists without it.
 *
 * Every claim either carries the passage or the line it came from, or says on itself that it has
 * nothing behind it. See src/learn/types.ts.
 *
 * Ships off, like every feature. See docs/configuration.md, "Understanding something".
