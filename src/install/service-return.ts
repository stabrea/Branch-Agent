 *     operating system is free to hand the same id out again, and a Branch that legitimately gets it is
 *     still a new Branch;
 *   - and it **answers**, on its own port, with this computer's saved key, saying the same version.
 *
 * Answers with the instance that came back, or null when none did in time.
