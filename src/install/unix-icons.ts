 * mac7/app-icon: the KeepOak mark in the sizes a Linux menu asks for.
 *
 * A menu, a dock and an alt-tab switcher each draw the icon at a different size. Given one big
 * picture they all shrink it themselves, badly; given an icon theme they pick the size that was made
 * for them. The Linux download therefore carries a folder of ready-made sizes (written by
 * scripts/package-linux.mjs) and the installer copies each one into this person's own icon theme.
 *
 * Pure names and numbers only, so both the packager and the installer agree without importing either.
