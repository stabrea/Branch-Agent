 * switched on, because a web page must never be able to reach a local service. A model runtime
 * the owner chose to use is different: it is the whole point of the feature. So a local-model call
 * goes through every rule the owner wrote (allowed and blocked hosts, allowed and blocked paths),
 * exactly as a web call does — blocking 127.0.0.1 or one path still stops it — and only the blanket
 * refusal of local addresses is skipped. Before any of that, the address must really be on this
 * computer; nothing else is ever reachable through here.
