/**
 * R17-069: going back to an earlier step of a flow, changing a value, and running a copy from there
 * (LangGraph's time travel and fork, `libs/langgraph/langgraph/pregel/main.py`, MIT; written for
 * Branch). The graph runner (src/flow-graph-run.ts) already keeps where a run has got to; one marked
 * line there hands this file the whole state after every box, so any box can be gone back to.
 *
 * Going back never changes the run it came from. A copy is a new task of its own, with the boxes up
 * to the chosen one copied across as they were, so its recording (Inbox › History) reads from the
 * start, and the original stays as the "undo". The copy runs as the owner's own flow run does: every
 * tool a box uses is held to the approval rules through the one tool gate, and a copy of a run a task
 * started keeps to that task's tools.
