/**
 * mac5/key-sweep: what a short-lived key (`branch token create`) may send, in one place.
 *
 * The rule fails closed. A key that is not this computer's own may only look (GET), and a "run"
 * key may in addition use the routes listed here, each of which starts, steers, stops or answers a
 * task, or only looks something up. Every other change — settings, permissions, secrets, the
 * sandbox and network, chat apps and pairing, integrations, backups and restores, updates, profiles —
 * is refused, including any route added later that nobody put on this list.
 *
 * A few reads are refused as well, because what they hand back outlives the key: a trigger's or
 * outgoing webhook's secret, the secret chat-app addresses, and the full backup of every profile.
 *
 * This only decides for short-lived keys. The master key is checked before any of this is asked,
 * so a mistake here can hold up a script and never lock the owner out of the app window.
