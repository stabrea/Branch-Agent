/**
 * Turning what was said in a conversation into something the assistant can look up later. A useful
 * thing said in passing — how a machine is wired, which supplier is the good one, what the code on
 * the gate is — is lost the moment the conversation scrolls away. This reads a finished conversation
 * and writes up what is worth keeping as fact cards: a title, a few sentences, the turn it came
 * from, and how sure it is.
 *
 * Every card is a suggestion. Nothing is added to a knowledge base until the owner accepts it in
 * the Memory screen, exactly as with every other thing the assistant proposes to remember. An
 * accepted card is indexed like a passage from a file, so a search finds it and can cite it.
