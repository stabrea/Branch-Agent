/**
 * The owner's control dashboard (wave mac3): a page of its own at /dashboard that shows at a glance
 * what Branch is doing, whether its parts are healthy, what it has cost, and what is happening now,
 * with the few controls an owner reaches for from a phone or a screen on the wall. It is served by
 * Branch itself behind the same key and the same host rules as the app window, so it is reachable over
 * the paired address exactly when the app is.
 *
 * Like every new feature it has the owner's three-way switch and ships off:
 * - off: the page and its files are not served at all, and the summary refuses;
 * - on: the page keeps itself up to date — the figures every few seconds and the live updates of
 *   what is happening;
 * - when-needed: the page is served but reads everything once, when it is opened or Refresh is
 *   pressed, and keeps nothing open in between.
 *
 * Looking needs any key that may look. Stopping a task goes through the existing route, so a key that
 * may start tasks may stop them. Everything else here — the switch itself, pausing every automation
 * and restarting the engine — needs the master key of this computer; a short-lived key never does it.
