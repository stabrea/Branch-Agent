 * mac7/adapt: naming what stopped a task, from the sentence Branch already said.
 *
 * Branch has said these things for a long time — "Git is not installed on this computer", "Not
 * enough disk space", "Your Mac is not letting Branch take pictures of the screen". This file adds
 * no new error language at all: it reads those sentences back and says which kind of missing thing
 * each one is, so `/adapt` can offer the right fix. A sentence it does not recognise is not a
 * blocker it understands, and it says so rather than guess.
 *
 * Pure, and takes no store, no runner and no network, so every kind is tested on every computer.
