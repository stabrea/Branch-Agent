/**
 * The owner's two switches for memory and skills that keep themselves in shape. Both ship off.
 *
 * Looking back (`reflection`):
 * - `off`: nothing runs.
 * - `when-needed`: a conversation is looked back over only when it is about to be shortened (the
 *   moment older turns would otherwise be summarised away), or when the owner asks.
 * - `on`: also every `everyTurns` turns of a conversation.
 *
 * Writing new skills (`newSkills`):
 * - `off`: nothing is drafted, and asking for one says the switch is off.
 * - `when-needed`: a skill is drafted only when asked — "make this into a skill", the button, or
 *   accepting a skill idea — and the assistant sees one short tool for the first of those.
 * - `on`: also after a finished task that looked like a repeatable procedure, and a look back may
 *   suggest one.
 *
 * Whatever the positions, nothing is written or switched on without the owner saying yes.
 *
 * The trigger model (off / every N steps / on compaction, default 25) follows Letta Code's
 * `reflection-settings.ts` (Apache-2.0); see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
