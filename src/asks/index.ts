/**
 * Bucket 23 (wave mac6): the smaller asks — project boards, quick answers and kept pages, long
 * articles, the intent pipeline, bringing items in from other services, a Hindsight memory server,
 * steps for other apps, consented usage counts, live tool pages, other Branch computers and the
 * app-server protocol. `createBranch` makes one of these; the server hands it /api/asks/. Every part
 * ships off. See docs/configuration.md, "The smaller asks".
