/**
 * Execution counters sent to a collector the owner runs (A1751).
 *
 * Other agents emit "anonymous execution metrics" to their makers. Branch never does: there is no
 * telemetry, and there never will be (docs/configuration.md). What the owner *can* have is the same
 * measurements — tasks started, finished and failed, tokens, estimated money, tool calls and
 * failures — sent to the address they typed under Settings → Advanced → Traces, which is theirs.
 *
 * The switch has three positions and ships off:
 *   off          nothing is ever sent
 *   when-needed  sent only when the owner presses "Send the counters now"
 *   on           sent after a task finishes, at most once every `minutesBetween` minutes
 * Nothing goes anywhere unless sending traces is also on, because that is where the address is.
 * The counters carry no names, no prompts, no files and no identifier of the person or computer.
