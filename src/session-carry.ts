/**
 * What a conversation is carrying, written down so it survives the app being closed: the model it
 * was set to, how hard it was asked to think, the project it belongs to, the toolboxes it had open
 * and the standing yeses given in it.
 *
 * The point of writing it down separately from the live settings is honesty. Asking the model
 * settings for a preset that has since been removed quietly answers "none", and asking for a
 * project that has been deleted quietly answers "default". A conversation that comes back after a
 * restart with a different model and a different project, saying nothing, is the thing this is
 * built to stop: the names are kept here, compared on the way back, and anything that could not be
 * put back is named in plain words rather than papered over.
 *
 * This is checkpoint-and-resume for a conversation and its tasks. A graph flow keeps its own place
 * in its own way (see src/flows.ts, built separately); nothing here touches it.
