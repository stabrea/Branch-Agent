/**
 * A second look before an approval (wave mac3, tool-safety; GAPS.md top ten #6).
 *
 * A second model reads a tool call before the approval card and answers two questions: does this
 * call only look at things, and, judged against the owner's own plain-English rules, should it go
 * ahead, wait for a yes, or be refused? Its powers are deliberately lopsided:
 *
 *  - **Only reads?** is asked only about tools that do not say for themselves (another AI tool's
 *    tools, most of all), and only for tasks the owner started. A "yes" is fed to the owner's rules
 *    as a fact about the call, so it can get past a rule written for changes and never past one
 *    written for everything.
 *  - **Go ahead, ask, or refuse?** can only make the answer stricter. A refusal becomes a question
 *    carrying the reason, which the owner may overrule once and never for good (src/approvals.ts).
 *  - Anything that goes wrong — no answer in time, too little budget, a reply that cannot be read —
 *    leaves the decision exactly as the rules made it, and says why in the task's record.
 *
 * It ships off. "When needed" looks only at tools that do not say what they do and at commands no
 * rule has decided about; "on" also looks at every call that would stop for a yes and at every
 * command and unknown tool the rules would let through.
 *
 * The shape follows Goose's permission judge and adversary inspector and Codex's guardian
 * (Apache-2.0; see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). It was written afresh.
