/**
 * mac7/usage-bar: how much of each service's allowance is left, for every connection attached.
 *
 * The rule the whole feature exists for: **Branch shows what it was told, says who told it, says
 * when, and says plainly where it was told nothing.** Every other product in this space fills the
 * silence with arithmetic of its own and prints it in the same typeface as a real number. Branch
 * does not. A row is in exactly one of three states, and a reader learns the vocabulary once:
 *
 *   measured       a service said this, in a header on Branch's own traffic or at an endpoint it
 *                  documents and Branch is allowed to call
 *   estimated      Branch worked it out from its own counting; the row says so and says from what
 *   not published  the service publishes nothing Branch may lawfully read. This is a good answer,
 *                  not an error, and it renders as a sentence with no bar at all
 *
 * What Branch will never do to fill a row, whatever other menu-bar apps do: read another
 * application's credential file or Keychain item, import browser cookies, call an endpoint the
 * provider has not documented, drive a provider's own program to harvest a figure it prints, or
 * make a request whose only purpose is to read the headers that come back — on a plan account that
 * request spends the very allowance it is measuring.
