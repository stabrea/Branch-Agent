 * One switch that shuts everything down at once. Turning Lockdown on makes every tool wait for the
 * owner's yes — the yeses already given for a conversation are ended too, by the route that sets it,
 * or an answer given earlier would keep standing in for the question — and switches off the things
 * that reach past this app on their own: running a script, leaving a program running, using the
 * screen and keyboard, borrowing the owner's browser, and sending anything out, which is both
 * messages and notes to other programs.
 *
 * What made it possible to turn back on again is the exact settings that were there before. They
 * are copied, untouched, into one kept record; turning Lockdown off writes those same settings back
 * and nothing else, so a switch that was already off before stays off afterwards. Both moments are
 * written into the record of what the assistant was allowed to do.
