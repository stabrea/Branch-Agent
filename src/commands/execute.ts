/**
 * Carries out one typed command for a surface (wave mac3, commands). The rules, in order:
 *
 * 1. A line that is not a command the surface can take right now is not a command: the caller
 *    treats it as it always did (a message, or "I do not know that one").
 * 2. The key must allow what the command does. Looking needs any key; starting a task needs a key
 *    that may start tasks; changing settings or permissions needs the key of this computer, and in
 *    the window also the owner's own profile — exactly what the matching API route asks, or more.
 * 3. A chat app never gets a command that changes settings or permissions, whoever sent it.
