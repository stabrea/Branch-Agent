 * `/tokens`: what fills the next request, the idea of Aider's `/tokens` (Apache-2.0) written for
 * Branch. It reuses the figures a task already writes before each round (the `context.budget`
 * event: instructions, the list of tools, the conversation, the room kept for the answer), so it
 * reports what Branch really measured rather than a second guess. A conversation with no task yet
 * is measured from its stored messages, and so is one folded since that measure (the measure was
 * taken before the fold). Otherwise the larger of the two counts: the stored messages also hold the
 * answer written after the last measure.
