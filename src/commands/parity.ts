/**
 * The slash commands of other agents, each set beside what Branch does for it (wave mac3,
 * commands). Studied from the clones in ~/Code/agent-refs on 2026-09-17: Hermes Agent
 * (`hermes_cli/commands.py`, MIT), OpenClaw (`src/auto-reply/commands-registry.shared.ts`, MIT),
 * Codex (`codex-rs/tui/src/slash_command.rs`, Apache-2.0), Gemini CLI (`packages/cli/src/ui/commands`,
 * Apache-2.0), OpenCode (`packages/app` slash entries, MIT), Aider (`aider/commands.py`,
 * Apache-2.0), and OpenHands (study only). Claude Code's list is from its public documentation.
 * No code was taken from any of them; the names are listed so the owner can see the match.
 *
 * `branch` is the Branch command, or "—" when there is none; `status` says why.
