 * The owner's three-way switch for the commands the shared table added (wave mac3, commands). It
 * ships "when needed" (`commandsShipAs`), and it never touches a command a surface already had:
 *
 *   off          each surface keeps exactly the commands it had before; anything else typed with
 *                a slash is what it always was there (a message, or "I do not know that one")
 *   when-needed  every command in the table works when it is typed, but the lists and menus show
 *                only the everyday ones; `/help all` shows the rest
 *   on           every command works and every list shows it
 *
 * The chat apps have their own switch as well (chat-live-settings.ts), which still decides whether
 * a chat reads commands at all; this one decides which of the table's commands it may read.
