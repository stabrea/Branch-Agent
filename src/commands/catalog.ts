/**
 * Every slash command Branch understands, on every surface, as one table (wave mac3, commands).
 *
 * This file is data and nothing else: no runtime, no store, no screen. The app window's message box,
 * the phone (which shows the same window through the paired address), the `branch` terminal view,
 * the chat apps and the browser dashboard all read their list from here, so a command added here
 * shows up everywhere it claims at once, and no surface keeps a list of its own.
 *
 * Each command says:
 * - `surfaces`: where it can be typed;
 * - `legacy`: where it already worked before this table existed. Those keep working whatever the
 *   owner's switch says; everywhere else the command follows the switch in `settings.ts`, which
 *   ships "when needed": the command works when typed, and the lists show only the everyday ones;
 * - `level`: what the key (or chat sender) must be allowed: look, start tasks, or be the owner.
 *   `bareLooks` marks a command that only reads when typed on its own (`/lockdown` says whether
 *   Lockdown is on; `/lockdown on` changes it);
 * - `route`: the existing API route the command stands for, when there is one, so the short-lived
 *   key limits of that route can be checked against the command's level;
 * - `whileWorking`: one of the few that matter while a task is working (the chat apps' "when
 *   needed" setting reads only those).
 *
 * The idea of one registry with a scope per surface follows OpenClaw's
 * `src/auto-reply/commands-registry.shared.ts` (MIT); the table itself is written for Branch.
