/**
 * mac7/live-voice: speak, and see the words as you say them. On this computer, for nothing, and
 * nothing is sent anywhere.
 *
 * Four things are true of it and are checked by the tests rather than promised here:
 *
 *   • **It holds the microphone open while it is listening, and says so before you switch it on.**
 *     That is the whole feature, and it is the one place this differs from the word that starts a
 *     turn, which takes one window at a time and lets go every window. The card says it in those
 *     words, above the switch, and docs/configuration.md says it too.
 *   • **A quiet room lets go of it.** Nobody speaking for a few seconds ends the phrase and ends
 *     the program that holds the microphone. Nothing here keeps a microphone open for a room that
 *     has gone quiet, whatever the switch says.
 *   • **Nothing is written down.** No file is written, no file name is ever an argument, the sound
 *     is never kept past the piece being written out, and the words go to the screen rather than
 *     into a record. Nothing is fetched and nothing is sent.
 *   • **It fills the message box; it does not send.** The words land where typed words land and a
 *     person presses send. Hearing something grants nothing.
 *
 * It ships **off**. With no streaming speech program on this computer it says which one to install
 * and stays off; Branch installs none of its own, and downloads none.
