 * The screen and keyboard tools.
 *
 * They are registered whether or not the owner has switched them on, and each one checks the
 * switch again when it is called: that way turning the switch off stops work already under way,
 * and the assistant is told plainly why it cannot carry on instead of the tools quietly vanishing.
 *
 * None of these permissions is on the read-only list in `policy.ts`, so under "Ask before changes"
 * every one of them stops and asks the owner first. Looking at the screen counts as a change here
 * on purpose: a photograph of someone's screen is not a free action.
