 * A site skill: the handful of things that are odd about one particular website, written down in

 * that puts a cookie notice over everything, a listing site that draws its rows a moment after the
 * page opens, a table whose columns never change — each of those is a line of data in a
 * `site.json` beside the skill's instructions, not a special case in Branch.
 *
 * Everything here is data and only data: selectors, a wait, a pause and named readings. There is
 * deliberately no place to put a piece of script, because a skill can arrive from anyone. A site
 * skill can also never widen what Branch may do — it cannot add a website to the allowed list, and
 * a bank, broker, password manager or mailbox is refused as a site skill outright.
