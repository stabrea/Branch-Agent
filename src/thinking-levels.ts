/**
 * Redesign phase 2 (accounts, critique #22): which thinking levels a connection's model really takes.
 *
 * Branch sends a thinking level in exactly three places, and nowhere else, so this map is those three:
 * - `reasoning_effort` (low / medium / high) from the OpenAI-shaped connection (src/providers.ts) and Azure
 *   OpenAI (src/providers/azure-openai.ts, the same body), and
 *   `reasoning.effort` from the Responses API connection (src/providers/openai-responses.ts, which
 *   Perplexity's agent connection extends) and the ChatGPT sign-in (src/chatgpt-provider.ts);
 * - an extended-thinking budget of 1,024 / 4,096 / 8,192 tokens from the Anthropic connection
 *   (src/providers.ts, `anthropicThinking`), which Claude on Vertex extends.
 * Every other connection (Gemini's own, Ollama, Cohere, Bedrock, the installed programs)
 * ignores the level, so the window offers none for it rather than a control that does nothing.
 *
 * Within those, only models that think take a level: sending one to a model that does not is refused
 * by the service or ignored. The families below are the ones their services document as reasoning
 * models; a model outside them is offered no level (the safe side: nothing breaks, nothing is faked).
 * `sent` says whether Branch would still send a level saved earlier (true for those providers), so
 * the window can say so honestly instead of claiming the level is unused.
