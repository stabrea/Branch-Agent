 * `branch.prepare_source_change` asks the model to propose the terms (which paths, which tools, which
 * tests, what "done" means, what else it touches, how to undo it). Branch adds what the model may not
 * choose: the exact source commit and the worktree. The contract is stored once, with a hash of its
 * contents, in a table that refuses edits and removals. Every call that could change something inside
 * `branch-agent-source` is then checked against it (`contractGuard`, run by `ToolRegistry.execute`).
 * A call outside the contract is refused and written in the audit record. A wider contract is a new
 * revision, made only by `branch.widen_source_contract`, which the owner is asked about every time.
