/**
 * Batch 20 (wave 8): using a coding assistant already installed on this computer as a model.
 *
 * Claude Code, Codex and GitHub Copilot all have a command line that answers one question and
 * prints the answer. Where the owner already pays for one of those, this lets Branch ask it instead
 * of a model service: nothing is sent to an address of Branch's choosing, no key is stored, and the
 * tool's own sign-in is the only sign-in there is.
 *
 * What this shape deliberately does not do:
 *   - it does not hold a conversation of its own. Branch's transcript is flattened into one prompt.
 *   - it does not ask the tool to call Branch's tools. The tool answers in words; Branch decides.
 *   - it opens no address itself. Whatever the tool reaches is the tool's business and the owner's,
 *     which is why the catalog row says "uses your installed tool and its own sign-in".
 *
 * The command is one of the rows below, or one the owner typed themselves. Nothing here is ever
 * built out of what the model said: the arguments are fixed and the prompt goes in on stdin.
