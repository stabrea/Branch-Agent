 * What Windows itself will let this app do. Branch has always had its own switches — "Allow the

 * switches of its own, under Settings > Privacy & security, and a refusal there looks to a program
 * like nothing happening at all. Asking first means the person is told what to turn on, in one plain
 * sentence with the button that opens the right page, instead of watching something quietly fail.
 *
 * Nothing here asks Windows for a permission: only the person can grant one. It reads what they
 * have already chosen, and for the screen it tries the smallest possible action to find out.
 *
 * A Mac keeps the same kind of switches under System Settings > Privacy & Security, plus one more,
 * Accessibility, for pressing keys and clicking in other apps. Merely asking a Mac about one of them
 * can put a question on the screen, so on a Mac nothing is asked at all: each switch is explained,
 * with the link that opens its page. On Linux the desktop session decides what works, so that is
 * what is read and said.
