/* Settings › Advanced, pass 17 (prototype patch17b): "What it can do", the model tools that only need a switch.
   A switch shows the engine's own mode (on unless "off"), turns on as "when-needed" and off as "off":
   Read links you paste is POST /api/web-pages { mode } (web.page and web.crawl); Smart home is
   POST /api/personal/switch { part: "home-control", mode }. Deep research, exact document edits and tables from
   spreadsheets have no switch of their own in the engine, and GitLab has no connection, so those stay greyed.
   The Memory and Health rows have no readout in the window yet (greyed). */
