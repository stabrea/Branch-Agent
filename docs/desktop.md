# Branch Agent desktop

The native client shares the runtime and interface with the local web application. It starts a loopback service, opens an authenticated Electron window, and keeps scheduling active when the window is hidden to the tray.

## Run and package

```sh
npm ci
npm run desktop
npm run package:desktop
```

The portable Windows folder is `release/Branch Agent-win32-x64/`; launch `Branch Agent.exe` inside it. Keep the whole folder together. The Windows build is unsigned and does not install shortcuts, a startup service or automatic updates; the macOS build is signed with the project's own certificate once the owner turns signing on, which is what keeps its permissions across updates (see below). Those distribution capabilities remain on the feature inventory.

Electron is a development dependency because it supplies the native window, platform tray and bundled runtime. Electron Packager creates the distributable directory. Fontsource packages supply locally bundled typefaces; each font's license accompanies it. The package includes only runtime files, public assets, production dependencies, package metadata and notices.

## State and configuration

Desktop private state and workspace default to separate `state` and `workspace` subdirectories beneath Electron's user-data directory for Branch Agent. `BRANCH_DATA_DIR` and `BRANCH_WORKSPACE` override them. Model connections can be saved in Settings with device-protected keys; explicit `BRANCH_PROVIDER` environment configuration takes precedence. See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for model, key-recovery and integration behavior.

`BRANCH_DESKTOP_HOME` can select a separate Electron profile, for example for an isolated evaluation. Profiles contain UI caches and the default state location. Do not point two running applications at the same data directory.

Forest/Daylight preferences live in the application database, so they survive service port changes and app restarts. The renderer cannot read Node APIs or the session-token file. The main process adds authorization only to the local window's API requests.

## Sign-in and updates

`chatgpt-auth.json` in the user data folder holds the ChatGPT sign-in, encrypted with Electron `safeStorage`. The renderer only ever receives sign-in status, never tokens. Updates run in the main process (`updater.ts`): Branch accepts only a final `vX.Y.Z` release, downloads its archive to the temp folder, verifies the published SHA-256, and requires the embedded package name and version to match before any safety copy or hand-over. The checked archive is expanded and applied after the app exits. The renderer may open only `https://auth.openai.com/` and the project's GitHub pages through `branch:open-external`.

## macOS: the first open, and permissions that are kept

The Mac download is signed with a certificate the project made itself, with
`scripts/make-mac-signing-certificate.sh`. It costs nothing and it is not an Apple Developer ID. Here
is exactly what it does and does not do, because the two are easy to confuse.

**What it fixes.** macOS remembers a permission against the app's *identity*, not its name or its
place on disk. An ad-hoc seal — what the build falls back to with no certificate — makes that identity
a hash of the app's own contents, so every build is a different app and microphone, screen recording
and accessibility are asked for again on every update. Signing with a certificate makes the identity
the bundle identifier plus the certificate, neither of which changes between builds, so **permissions
granted once are kept across every later update**. The bundle identifier `com.keepoak.branch-agent` is
half of that identity: changing it throws away every grant, which is why a test pins its exact value.

**What it does not fix.** Nothing about the first-open warning. macOS still refuses to open the app
straight from a browser download, exactly as it does today. The way through, on macOS 15 and later
(Apple removed the old Control-click shortcut):

> **System Settings → Privacy & Security →** scroll to the message about Branch Agent **→ Open Anyway
> → Open.**

That is **once per install, not once per update** — the app the updater puts in place is not
quarantined, so later versions open without it. Only a paid Apple Developer ID and notarisation remove
the warning altogether; the packaging already prefers `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` and notarises with it
if the project ever buys one, and nothing else would need to change.

**The one release that asks again.** The release where the certificate first appears changes the app's
identity once, so every person grants microphone, screen recording and accessibility one final time.
Say so in that release's notes. Every update after it is silent.

**Windows is different and is not fixed by this.** Windows has no permissions to lose, but it shows
"Windows protected your PC" (More info → Run anyway) and, for an unsigned app, shows it again for
**every new release** until SmartScreen reputation builds. A self-made certificate buys nothing at all
on Windows — Microsoft treats it the same as no signature.

**How the build proves it.** After signing, `scripts/package-desktop.mjs` reads back the requirement
macOS will enforce (`codesign -d -r-`) and refuses the build unless it names
`com.keepoak.branch-agent` and a `certificate root`, and never a `cdhash`. The requirement is printed
as a one-line identity receipt, which belongs in the release notes:

```
Identity receipt: identifier "com.keepoak.branch-agent" and certificate root = H"…"
```

Signing is switched on by the repository variable `MAC_SIGNING_REQUIRED=true` (Settings, Secrets
and variables, Actions, Variables), set beside the three secrets `MAC_SIGNING_P12_BASE64`,
`MAC_SIGNING_P12_PASSWORD` and `MAC_SIGNING_SHA1`.

- **Switched on:** a missing certificate, a failed import, or a `cdhash` requirement refuses the
  release loudly, before anything is zipped. A release that would silently reset everyone's
  permissions therefore fails instead of shipping. `npm run package:desktop -- --release` does the
  same locally when `MAC_SIGNING_REQUIRED=true` is in the environment.
- **Not switched on:** the release goes ahead unsigned, exactly as before, with a warning in the job
  summary that every update will ask for permissions again. A plain local build is unsigned and silent.
- **A signing secret with no variable** refuses the release: that is a setup that was never finished.

## Smart App Control and the executable

Windows Smart App Control blocks unsigned executables it has never seen. The packager normally rewrites the executable's icon and version resources, so every build has a new, unknown hash; on a machine with Smart App Control on, that build is refused ("An Application Control policy has blocked this file"). Until releases are code-signed, `scripts/package-desktop.mjs` copies the stock Electron executable (a widely known hash) over `Branch Agent.exe` after packaging. Window, tray and taskbar icons are set at runtime, so only the file icon in Explorer differs. The update hand-over script keeps the previous version in `<install>.previous` and restores it when the new executable does not start within fifteen seconds.

## Verification boundary

The native test exercises a task that writes and verifies a file, checks renderer isolation, blocks navigation to a real local server outside the permitted origin, checks that tokens are absent from URL/HTML/session storage, changes appearance across reload and process restart, hides the window to tray, and verifies the process and loopback listener stop on quit.

The offline provider is deterministic. A working native shell does not establish live model access, a signed installer, automatic updates or complete capability parity.
